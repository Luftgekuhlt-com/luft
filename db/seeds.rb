Tommy the owner of the joint is an old BMXer, so who better to host the first annual get together for those who want to remember and reminisce about their good-old BMX days. The museum had a great display of classic bikes, old issues of Ernie&rsquo;s Bicycle Scene newspaper, and outside was a sea of BMX parts, legendary bikes, and memorabilia from yesteryear. The coolest thing was, though, that it was a place for like-minded people to come together and shoot the shit.</p>\r\n<p>Today, Ernie cruises into Fasthouse every morning around 8:00am to tell his son Kenny how to run the shop.</p>\r\n<p><em>Photos by Brendan Lutes</em></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

  {document_id: 32, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>When I was a kid, my entire family would pile into our Mini Wini, with the flatbed trailer in tow, bound for a weekend in the wide-open Southern California Mojave Desert. Trips like that were some of the best memories of my childhood&mdash;trying to look like my heroes while I chased my dad over the rocks, whoops, and sand. I still remember the day that we stopped on the side of the trail&mdash;I was on my CR80; my dad aboard his KDX200&mdash;and he said to me with honest excitement in his voice, &ldquo;Wow, you&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; fast. Every time I looked back to check on you, you were right behind me.&rdquo; As the years went on, I progressed, racing took over, I soon went off to college, and our regular trail riding trips became fewer and fewer. But to this day, every time we get a chance to ride together, I never pass it up. Riding with my dad is one of coolest things I get to do on a motorcycle. And when we got the invite from our good friends Larry Atnip and Massis Chahbazian to attend the annual Best In The Desert Nevada 200 Trail Ride, we couldn&rsquo;t pass it up.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nevada Trail Ride has been going on for over 30 years. Originally promoted and organized by the late Casey Folks, along with his son Darryl and off-road legend Scott Harden, the ride covers 200 miles of picturesque Nevada terrain just north of Las Vegas, and as an invite-only ride, the number of riders is usually kept at the perfect amount for the miles of single-track trails and abundant good times. Since I wanted to enjoy every moment of the ride, though, I decided to leave my professional camera behind&mdash;something that was tough to do&mdash;and just enjoy the experience with my dad, stopping only to bench race, drink some water, and take casual cell phone pictures.</p>\r\n<p>Being that it was our first year attending for my dad and I, we didn&rsquo;t really know what to expect, but as I drove to the small town of Caliente on the first day to meet up with my dad and everyone else, I began to climb over the mountain that led into town, and the snow on the ground became more and more abundant. After checking in, we unloaded our bikes, geared up, and attended the rider&rsquo;s meeting before embarking on the first day of riding, which was without a doubt going to be cold and interesting.</p>\r\n<p>My dad and I left base camp together and rode down a transfer road with everyone else before jumping into a soft snow covered sand wash. Having little to no experience in the snow, I watched my dad in front of me pinned aboard his CRF250R with his feet off the pegs, paddling through the snow, and I thought to myself, &ldquo;Wow, if this is how difficult snow is, this is going to be quite the day&hellip;&rdquo; But after a couple falls, and stopping to put on some rubber gloves to keep my hands warm, the sandy trail soon wound into single track through the trees. After that, the entire day was spent cutting in fresh tracks and enjoying the scenery. With that said, though, the day wasn&rsquo;t without sketchy moments. If I got out of the main line, I found myself all over the countryside on more than one occasion, bouncing off rocks like a ping-pong ball. I also got the chance to see a guy wrap himself around a tree after he hit a hidden rock, swapped out, and promptly high-sided directly into the side of an immoveable nearby tree. It all goes into what makes trail riding so fun. As long as you can laugh about it later, it was a good idea.</p>\r\n<p>The next day, we woke up bright and early to blue bird conditions and perfect springtime temperatures. But while I shoveled in some fresh scrambled eggs with everyone else at the local American Legion Post, I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder how muddy it would get once the snow began to melt. As we made our way into the mountains during the first part of the day, we wound through perfect desert single track. After hitting the gas stop, though, the conditions changed drastically, as we began to hit melting snow and supremely muddy conditions in the higher elevations. Being that we&rsquo;re all from California, the mud was nothing short of a challenge, and I followed behind my dad during the final 20 miles before lunch. Every time we stopped to regroup, he kept asking if I wanted to pass, but I never did. Instead I decided to keep a safe distance back in order to watch what lines he took or where the rocks were to miss. Basically, if he got loose&mdash;and he definitely did a few times&mdash;I knew not to take that line. Sorry Dad, but just like when I was on my 80, you were the trail guinea pig. After miles of sloppy mud, we made it to lunch with huge smiles on our muddy faces, thankful to get a break and a chance to bull shit with everyone else.</p>\r\n<p>Arguably the coolest aspect of the ride is the camaraderie, which is very apparent at the lunch stop during the second day. Out in the middle of nowhere, the BITD crew organized a fully catered lunch, and before you even eat, you grab a hot towel to clean up with and play a hand of electronic poker, which the winner is announced at the wrap-up dinner later that night. Everyone sat at the tables, ate homemade pulled-pork sandwiches, and bench raced about the first half of the day. And once our stomachs were full, causing a few guys some unpleasant heartburn for the last section, we jumped on our bikes for the final 20 miles back to town.</p>\r\n<p>That night, the annual Easter Egg Run was held right before dinner followed by the hilariously entertaining Whistle Dick awards. If you&rsquo;ve ever been to a Best In The Desert event, you&rsquo;ve likely heard BITD founder Casey Folks lovingly&mdash;or not so lovingly&mdash;refer to people who make dumb decisions as &ldquo;whistle dicks&rdquo;. This year, in keeping with Casey&rsquo;s fun-loving award ceremony, his son Darryl and Scott Harden did the honors on Casey&rsquo;s behalf, awarding various riders with a small pink whistle dick for their actions over the past couple days. Each award was just as funny as the previous, and everyone drank beer, laughed, and had a good time the only way Casey would have wanted it&mdash;a bunch of motorcycle riders making fun of each other.</p>\r\n<p>When I sit back and think about where I&rsquo;ve been because of motorcycles, none of it has been as cool as the times I&rsquo;ve spent with my dad&mdash;either chasing him or him chasing me. Since I first started riding, he has been by my side through it all and even though neither of us are as quick as we used to be, or get to ride together as often as we used to, twisting the throttle, throwing mud, and laughing still is at the top of my list of things I love to do with my dad. Getting the opportunity to participate in the Nevada Trail ride was rad, and as long as my dad or I can lift our legs over the top of a dirt bike, we&rsquo;ll be attending. Until next time&mdash;as Casey would say&mdash;booyah!!!</p>\r\n<p><em>By Brendan Lutes</em></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

After dominating the pro race last year, Blayne Thompson came into the event ready to defend his King of Adelanto title. Unfortunately, after taking over the lead and opening up a sizeable gap over the field, Saturday's pro race was red flagged due to an injured rider. With the sun quickly dropping, the officials made the decision to restart the race first thing Sunday morning. Even with the restart, though, Blayne managed to hold off challenges from the competition to once again take home the Adelanto crown and lion's share of the huge pro purse. Behind him, Willy Simons Jr. rode his ass off aboard his trusty YZ250 two-stroke to take home the win in the Pro 2 Class. With a ton of rad shots to share, we decided to put together a Fasthouse Story photo feature. <a href=\"http://thefasthouse.com/stories/fifth-gear-tapped\" target=\"_blank\">CLICK HERE</a> to check it out.</p>\r\n<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Pro:</strong></p>\r\n<p>1.

Since the age of three he&rsquo;s been on two wheels, riding and racing alongside his older brother, RJ, under the guidance of their dad. After completing the Arenacross series last year, Robbie earned his professional license and the opportunity to live out his dream of racing Supercross in 2017.</p>\r\n<p>After months of preparation, the 17-year-old entered Anaheim stadium for the first time last weekend, lined up against his heroes, and turned some heads with his speed and tenacity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>NAME:</strong> Robbie Wageman</p>\r\n<p><strong>HOMETOWN:</strong> Santa Clarita, California</p>\r\n<p><strong>AGE:</strong> 17</p>\r\n<p><strong>YEARS RIDING:</strong> 14</p>\r\n<p><strong>What were your thoughts going into your first professional Supercross race?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Going into my first pro race, I was definitely really excited. My first goal was to obviously make it to the night show, which I did. My second goal was to complete all the laps that I could, and if I made the main, that would be great. But I just wanted to complete as many laps as I could. I&rsquo;m just focused on making improvements for next weekend and continue getting better.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What was the biggest surprise of the weekend?</strong></p>\r\n<p>There really weren&rsquo;t any big surprises. I knew that if I got myself up there with the top guys, I could run their pace. I just have to get a good start.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Was it a surreal feeling to walk into the stadium for the first time?</strong></p>\r\n<p>It was definitely a surreal moment when I first walked into the stadium for track walk. I was stoked. It was awesome, because there&rsquo;s just no better feeling than doing that. I&rsquo;ve done Monster Cup for the past five years, but there&rsquo;s nothing like racing Supercross in Anaheim&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing like it. Monster Cup is a cool learning experience, and it gets you prepared for all the people in the stadium, but racing actual Supercross in Anaheim is a different feeling&mdash;in a better way. It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are some of the goals that you&rsquo;ve set for yourself?</strong></p>\r\n<p>For me to just progress every weekend; I want to make the main consistently; and get myself up there with those top guys to see what I can do.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Being 17 is pretty young to turn pro, right?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a young age and everyone always asks me that. At this point, I feel really comfortable in Supercross, and I had more to gain than lose if I stayed in amateurs for another year.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Any crazy things happen to you during the weekend? Any fans ask you to sign anything weird?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Hopefully if I make it in the main I&rsquo;ll get to sign some cool stuff (laughs), but there were a few people that came over. It was a cool experience to get to sign some autographs&mdash;some young kids and older people that didn&rsquo;t really know anything about motocross. That was really cool. I had a decent get-off in practice, which didn&rsquo;t really set me back, but it was scary. I went over the bars and had to regroup from that one. Other than that, I had a great experience racing my first Supercross. I&rsquo;m looking forward to San Diego.</p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

  {document_id: 62, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>It&rsquo;s been over 10 years since I&rsquo;ve attended a professional motocross race as a spectator behind the fence line and in the beer line. I&rsquo;ve been traveling the world as a motocross photographer and magazine editor for my entire post-college adult life. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s been great&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen and done more things than most people get to do in a lifetime. I&rsquo;ve tested factory bikes, gone for a ride in Chad Reed&rsquo;s rally car, ridden the Motocross of Nations track&mdash;in France&mdash;the day after Dungey and Villopoto clinched the championship, visited some of the most iconic tracks around the world, gotten to know many of the sports greatest riders&hellip; that&rsquo;s just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. But what I haven&rsquo;t done is enjoy a foot-long hot dog and ice-cold beer while dodging roost and hanging over the trackside fence at a National or Grand Prix.</p>\r\n<p>With the Glen Helen USGP slated for this past weekend, and no real reason for me to trudge around all day, snapping endless photos, I decided it was the perfect opportunity to experience motocross the way it should be. Like a true spectator, I didn&rsquo;t even have access to the pits&mdash;just a regular general admission wristband, because lets be honest, pit passes are expensive. I still slung my trusty camera over my shoulder, though, only this time I put on one short lens&mdash;no 300mm 2.8 or quiver of various lenses weighing me down&mdash;just my camera in one hand and a frothy beer in the other. What I found was that I still love this sport of motocross just as much as my 12-year-old self, and that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve become a little jaded by all the glitz and glamour of the professional racing scene; all the long nights of writing race reports and editing photos have worn me down and diminished my enthusiasm for watching dirt bikes. But getting to be a fan again showed me the energy and excitement that&rsquo;s in the crowd, and that standing in the heat and dust all day is actually quite fun. It reminded me what the sport of motocross is all about&mdash;battling the elements, conquering fears, overcoming hardships, but most of all, fun.</p>\r\n<p>In the second moto, as Eli Tomac made his way to the front from a horrible start, the crowd erupted every time he went by&mdash;beer spilling, roost flying, and air horns blasting. It was truly cool soaking it all in, wandering around with my wife and buddies, as we looked for the next gnarly spot to watch the riders navigate. Standing back and observing from a perspective that I&rsquo;m not used to provided a new perspective on everything. I did get into the pits for a brief second, though, thanks to a buddy (whom shall remain nameless) who loaned me his wristband. Racing is badass, and I&rsquo;m going to be reliving this day where I didn&rsquo;t bother getting the all access photo pass, but instead roamed around the track, snapping photos that told the story of my day and the fun we all had at the races. We didn&rsquo;t necessarily care too much about missing great passes or insane battles. The day was all about watching some of the world&rsquo;s best riders tackle one of the world&rsquo;s toughest tracks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>MXGP</strong></p>\r\n<p>1.

  {document_id: 63, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>In spite of a couple crashes that kept my seat time to a minimum this year, I&rsquo;ve been riding a lot over the past few weeks, and I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; good. &ldquo;We race&hellip; sometimes.&rdquo; A joking moniker that became a serious reality of 2016, thanks in part to those crashes, has somehow become the theme of 2016 for me. We've been hard at work riding, racing sometimes, and filming all of it for an upcoming four-part series dubbed, \"We Race, Sometimes.\" It's action-packed with freeriding, fun, and \"sometimes\" racing. Be on the look out for the first video to drop in the coming weeks. For now, I just wanted to get you caught up on what&rsquo;s been going on.</p>\r\n<p>I've had a loose, yet serious, outlook on racing since I was a kid&mdash;I always have fun with it. When I was younger, my brother was the fast one, and I was the goof off who was doing tricks and chasing chicks. But even after all these years, when I really think about it, I'm starting to realize that I'm still exactly the same. After 25 years of racing, earning a lifetime AMA membership, and having more good times than I can remember, this party is just getting started! Over the past few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been back home&mdash;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefasthouse.com/the-scene/articles/home-sweet-home-durham-returns-to-pa\">which I wrote about last week</a>&mdash;enjoying some family time and a little racing.</p>\r\n<p>This past Saturday, we went riding at Rick Kresic's track out by the Pittsburgh Airport. While we were there, a friend mentioned a money race at Briarcliff in Ohio. It sounded like a good idea, so I went home, prepped the bikes, and left at 4:00 AM the next morning to make it in time for the two-lap practice sessions. Luckily the races were long, as I had to learn the track on the fly since it was my first time there. It was a great layout with some of the best dirt I have ridden anywhere in the country. I was able to win all four motos, and our cameraman Mike even hit the track for the 125cc Legends race, and promptly faded like a black T-shirt out there!</p>\r\n<p>The next morning, I went on an epic mountain bike ride with my brother Shane. I figured out quickly, though, that he wanted to kick my ass, as he turned up the heat on the trails at North Park. If that wasn't enough to be sore, the next day I jumped on the road bike with Broc Hepler to tag along as he preps for the International Six Day Enduro next month. After all that, I have to be getting in shape. More importantly, though, all that training earned a couple cold ones with Mike. Just as the brews cracked, and we began to relax at Mike&rsquo;s house, his Mom said she had free Kennywood tickets&mdash;one of the oldest amusement parks in America. Without hesitation, we pounded our drinks and headed out the door for Kennywood.</p>\r\n<p>Opening in 1899, my favorite rides are the old wooden coasters built almost 100 years ago. The Jack Rabbit was built in 1920 and has a double dip where I swear the coaster gets some hang time. Another ride dubbed The Racer was built in 1927 and has two coasters racing side-by-side all the way to the finish. The craziest part, though, is that if you start on the left side, you end on the right, meaning somehow the train switches sides&mdash;I still haven't figured it out. It was a weekday, so the lines were short and we had a blast. If you're ever in Pittsburgh and someone hollers Kennywood's open! Check your zipper.</p>\r\n<p>I'm only home a few more days before I head back to race the 125 Dream Race aboard the Hell Raiser 125 built by Jeske MX Customs. The bike looks badass and I'm excited to line up for my first-ever 125 race! I might have to dust off the old Honda of Troy 125 for a few laps this week. We&rsquo;re headed up to the Pacific Northwest next Wednesday, and we&rsquo;ll be documenting the whole trip and posting updates along the way.

The bravado it takes to successfully navigate one of these heavy bikes around a slick dirt track is not only impressive to watch, but it&rsquo;s also thoroughly entertaining. During this year&rsquo;s annual motorcycle pilgrimage to Sturgis, Roland Sands and Indian helped to put on one of the coolest races at the rally.</p>\r\n<p>Held at the huge Buffalo Chip Campgrounds, the Super Hooligan race, which also featured a pro flat track class, drew a huge crowd of spectators and riders to witness racing on a track that was laid out on the concert grounds; right in front of the stage where Willy Nelson, Lynard Skynard, Elle King, Weird Al Yankovic, and more were slated to perform later in the evening. While not everyone at Fasthouse was lucky enough to attend, our friend Chris Sackett from Bell Helmets made the trek to try his hand at Hooligan racing aboard a RSD Yamaha Bolt. And Leticia Cline spun some laps decked out in her FH gear. All told, the race was a resounding success in spite of the rain that fell prior.

And when Hell On Wheels decided to throw their Hot August Nights flat track race at Industry Hills Speedway this past weekend, we couldn&rsquo;t pass up the good time. What&rsquo;s better than strapping on a helmet, bringing just about any bike you want&mdash;including a smoke-belching three-wheeler if that's your thing&mdash;and throwing it sideways into the first corner? Aside from activities that are barely legal, there&rsquo;s not much that can top an evening of holding it wide, getting sketchy, and laughing every step of the way.</p>\r\n<p>After a brief rider&rsquo;s meeting, the evening started at around 6:00 with practice followed by heat races and main events. Hell On Wheels&rsquo; laid-back founder &ldquo;Meatball&rdquo; always puts on relaxed, fun events and this one was no exception. There was plenty of downtime to bullshit with buddies, check out the eclectic assortment of bikes, and partake in some cold ones if you weren&rsquo;t racing. On the track, the action was extremely entertaining&mdash;paint was traded, parts were bent, and egos were undoubtedly bruised after some of the crashes we witnessed. Our Fasthouse crew also made quite the impression over the course of the event, with a huge presence in the pits that included dirt bikes from just about every era and plenty of cold 805s in our ice chest.</p>\r\n<p>Decked out in the White Lightning jerseys&mdash;which have become an HoW tradition for us&mdash;the FH crew was either consistently up front or consistently having the most fun on the track. Tyler Bereman even raced with a cast on his left arm from a fresh break a few weeks ago, and in every race, he&rsquo;d somehow would &ldquo;not notice the checkered flag&rdquo; so he could sneak in a few extra laps. TB&rsquo;s dad Randy also made the drive from up north to race with his son, bringing out his immaculate Bultaco dirt track bike, aboard which he displayed some picture-perfect flat track style on his way to victory. He wasn&rsquo;t the only podium finisher in our group, though, as Brendan Lutes took the Vintage Class win, FH head honcho Kenny Alexander finished third in vintage, TB took the Mini Bike victory, Wacker finished second in Bomber, and Matt Cerami took second in the Modern Class. We definitely conquered the circle track, logging countless laps and dusting a case or two of 805s while smiling the entire time. Here&rsquo;s to the next time we get to have a good time at one of the Hell On Wheels&rsquo; events.

  {document_id: 66, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>Ever since Tony Jeske of Jeske MX Customs built a fully custom YZ125 for The 1 Moto show earlier this year, everyone was left wondering if it was built to rip or just built to be a piece of art. We&rsquo;re happy to report that along with Tony, we&rsquo;ve had big plans to race the beautiful machine dubbed Hell Raiser at the upcoming 125 Dream Race at Washougal MX Park in Washougal, Washington, on September 17<sup>th</sup>-18<sup>th</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>Since the beginning, Jeske has always wanted the bike to hit the dirt, and the plan has been to get a Fasthouse rider to compete aboard it. As luck would have it, with the Dream Race rapidly approaching, Darryn Durham&rsquo;s hectic schedule opened up, making him the easy choice as the rider lucky enough to put Hell Raiser&rsquo;s knobbies in the dirt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m super excited to ride it,&rdquo; Durham said. &ldquo;The bike is a work of art, so I&rsquo;m excited to hit the dirt for the first time and tear it up.&rdquo; Surprisingly enough, even though Durham has a 125 of his own back home in Pennsylvania, he has never lined up behind a gate aboard it. &ldquo;I got a 125 about five or six years ago just for fun, and I love riding it. I think riding 125s makes you a better four-stroke rider. I&rsquo;ve put some time in on it, but I&rsquo;ve never really raced a 125 before, so this will be my first ever 125 race.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As for the bike, Jeske built it almost on a whim. When invited to show a bike at the prestigious 1 Moto Show in Portland this year, Jeske didn&rsquo;t have a plan or a bike. But after procuring a YZ125 from local Portland dealership Power Motorsports, he decided to go all out, creating the Hell Raiser to drop jaws and get people talking about what a truly custom motorcycle is all about. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a 125 and it can scream,&rdquo; Tony said of the beautiful machine he created. &ldquo;The name has a purpose. I&rsquo;m stirring up a little bit of hell. What&rsquo;s wrong with being a little bit of a menace? That&rsquo;s kind of where my head was at when I sat down to design this bike. I want to grow my shop [Jeske MX Customs] and do things for a reason. I wanted to be different, raise some hell, and make a statement.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In only a couple short weeks, the Fasthouse crew will be making the trek up to Washington to do just that&mdash;make a statement with Durham screaming Jeske&rsquo;s Hell Raiser up the hills of Washougal. But according to Durham, he still has one thing to learn&hellip;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna have to figure out if it&rsquo;s a first or second gear start (laughs).&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Pacific Northwest better watch out&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>If you want to see Durham ripping his personal 125, check out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdTjP43R6Ck\">THIS VIDEO</a>.

  {document_id: 67, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>Sometimes you just have to get back to your roots. After being on the road all year, Mike LeGrand and I loaded up the van to head east for one more cross-country adventure&mdash;this time to Pennsylvania for some family time, good riding, and good times.</p>\r\n<p>Driving straight through the midnight storms, we finally arrived at Mike's at 7:00AM. And after spending months without his girls&mdash;and by girls, I mean bikes&mdash;Mike immediately woke up his Mom and started putting his bike together for an afternoon of riding with the boys at our local riding spot called Switchback. We had a ripping crew of riders and the track was a radical change from California&mdash;no hard-packed blue groove, just plenty of traction. There's nothing like a day of riding with your buds! It was my first time riding with my brothers Shane and B-rad in a couple years, so it felt like a family reunion on the track. Motorcycles are in the blood for our tight crew.</p>\r\n<p>After riding, I headed over to my Grandma's for dinner. I was greeted with my littlest brother Isaiah, already in his riding gear, as he ran to the garage stoked to show me that he could now start his 50. I hooked him up with a new set of goggles, which he broke in properly by burning a track in Grammy's lawn before dark. Needless to say, she wasn&rsquo;t too thrilled, but Isaiah had one hell of a time. Just as the sun went down, my Mom hollered us in for dinner, as it was time to share stories and eat some home cooked goodness with the fam.</p>\r\n<p>As if that wasn't enough for the first day, right after dinner we heard about a big \"field party\" going on that night in my hometown. Without hesitation, we grabbed the cameras and piled in the van to check it out. We pulled up to over 300 people jamming to a cover band on a makeshift stage. The best part, a slip-n-slide going right down to the front of the stage. The beer was flowing like water, which to our delight, resulted in a ladies topless slide-off, proving to me, that American's go harder than any other country we've been to this year&mdash;including Amsterdam.</p>\r\n<p>The next morning, I headed over to the PR2 Race Shop for some bike prep and to see my Pops. I was drenched in sweat from changing tires in the summer heat when he showed up and gave me a hug. He then promptly told me to get a job... Little does he know, my life is a traveling circus, and when I heard that the Hookstown Fair was throwing another race, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to put in a little work. To which he replied with a laugh, \"Oh yeah, you raced there in &lsquo;96 on a 50.\" I couldn't really remember the race, but twenty years later, I was stoked to be going back!</p>\r\n<p>As we were pulling into the fairgrounds for the race, the memories started rolling back. And then... I saw the Arena. It was much smaller than I remembered, but when I saw the grandstands the memories of racing as a kid came flooding back! I even remembered &ldquo;Mad Mike&rdquo; Jones winning that night in baggy gear on a number 52 Kawi! As it turned out, the evening was just as fun as I remembered. I lined up for the flag start right after the ATV Pro Main and greased my way to a win. After the checkered flag waved and the champagne sprayed, I took my winnings straight over for a lemonade and a stuffed animal, but Dale the Carny ripped me off for five bucks. Frustrated and still in my gear, I hit a couple rides and left my mark on the annual Hookstown Fair.</p>\r\n<p>I've only been home a few days, but it's already been a great trip. More rain, more riding, and more ridiculousness coming next week! Stay tuned! Mike is hard at work on a video, and we still have more good times ahead.</p>\r\n<p>Rubber side down!</p>\r\n<p><em>Words by Darryn Durham</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photos by Mike LeGrand and Tommy White</em></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

Durham was to escort &ldquo;Fatty Patty&rdquo; on the front of the 420 machine, but she clipped a foot on the exhaust pipe and deflated, abandoned in the staging area watching her friends ride off into the fray. Along with European Von Zipper Freewheeler Tristan Purdin, they roosted the shit out of raging fans, popped wheelies, and made an epic toss out for the fans, sending Yumi onto the next chapter of her illustrious life.</p>\r\n<p>After Tyler clipped the gate hinge from a second row start, he was awarded with the worst start of his career, but he still put his head down and got to work. Just before gate drop, he ripped off his ZwarteCross wristband which was cinching up on his right forearm, cutting off circulation and causing it to pump up like a piece of cauliflower. The newfound blood flow literally gave him back eight seconds a lap, putting down his best laps and most impressive ride of the week; even earning and invite to race the infamous Lommel event in Belgium the next weekend. Respectfully, he declined&mdash;European sand riders are no joke, and everyone was ready to log some R&amp;R in Amsterdam.</p>\r\n<p><b>DEATH CRUE WESTBOUND, NEXT STOP: THE ROYAL AMSTERDAM HOTEL</b></p>\r\n<p>For the next 3 days, they&rsquo;d switch from motorcycle racers to tourists. Decked out in fresh American gear from Fasthouse, DC, and Vonzipper, they stuck out like sore thumbs as they hit the streets in search of smoke-filled coffee shops, good times, and the finest pleasures that the city might have to offer. Over three days, the crew discovered art by Banksy, plentiful pre-rolls, catcalling women yelling, &ldquo;Blondie!&rdquo; to Bereman, espresso and truffles, and best of all&hellip; English speaking humans. Slightly intimidated by streets and buildings built in the early 1500&rsquo;s that are best navigated by bikes, it was exactly the cultural trip they&rsquo;d been hoping for. Amsterdam is a place best experienced rather than told about. While semi-legal weed and sinful sex are the lead-offs to every foreigner&rsquo;s Amsterdam tale, there&rsquo;s much more to the city than relaxed rules. It&rsquo;s a cultural melting pot, teeming with life and stories of self-expression that does not exist in the United States. Things in America are too new, too sanitized, and too politically correct. Making some awesome new friends along the way, The Viewing scored their first taste of Europe and fell in love.</p>\r\n<p>Be on the lookout for more global misadventures, even less f*cks given, and more creativity than ever coming out of The Viewing and their band of media marauders. They&rsquo;re challenging every established norm, smashing paradoxes, and proving to motorcycle riders that the best ride is the one where you have the most fun. We&rsquo;ll leave first place to the jocks, because when you&rsquo;re the happiest dude out there, you win every time, no matter what.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PREVIOUS REPORTS</strong></p>\r\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefasthouse.com/the-scene/articles/the-viewing-packin-black-road-report-number-one\"><strong>Number One</strong></a></p>\r\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefasthouse.com/the-scene/articles/the-viewing-dicke-titten-kartoffelsalat-road-report-number-two\"><strong>Number Two</strong></a></p>\r\n<p><em>Photos and Words by Aran Eversman</em></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

A couple years ago, while Fasthouse was steadily gaining notoriety&mdash;and the jerseys were cranking out and selling like hot cakes&mdash;Sean Collier got an invite to race with the Ox Motorsports team aboard their CRF450X at the annual Glen Helen 24 Hour event. Without hesitation, he took the invite, and we set up camp in the pits&mdash;in true FH style of course with an Airstream, tasty BBQ, and ice cold brews&mdash;in order to document the race in its entirety.</p>\r\n<p>What transpired was a story that has to be seen to fully understand. The race itself didn&rsquo;t go as planned for the foursome of Colton Udall, Ian Young, Mark Samuels, and Sean Collier, but it wasn&rsquo;t for lack of trying or preparation. Bad luck hindered them the entire 24 hours, relegating them to a runner-up finish. What we came away with was a three-part series of videos telling the full story&mdash;raw and gritty&mdash;about what truly went down. If you missed the video series, shame on you. It&rsquo;s a very entertaining glimpse into the world of professional off-road racing, team work, and what it takes to finish a 24 Hour motorcycle race.

  {document_id: 74, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>Our last entry signed off from the backseat of a Volkswagen mini van bound for ZwarteCross, where The Viewing&rsquo;s Darryn &amp; Tyler arrived a mere 20 minutes later to a giant-faced man, extremely upset by their lack of credentials and a mean u-turn over a double white line that seemed perfectly kosher to those of us from the states. In a land where everyone speaks multiple languages and we&rsquo;re stuck using hand signals and words like &ldquo;no understando&rdquo;, they quickly realized that the joke is on Americans when it comes to traveling overseas.</p>\r\n<p>In the riders paddock stood a lone race transporter: A badass flat front semi in full World Motocross dress. Darryn and Tyler were about to find themselves back in the factory saddle pitting out of the &uuml;ber-plush F&amp;H Kawasaki rig. Owned by the Harry Fase and his family, they made sure we were comfortable and introduced their new, awkward American friends to the family. Sending them towards the festival grounds with a knowing smile, they knew that there was no preparing for the weirdness ahead. Exchanging cash for Muntens and hopping bar to bar, the boys found themselves in a surreal world of LARPers, post-apocalyptic death machines, deep house music, and drag queens in a true cultural melting pot&mdash;no quarter asked and none given. Pumping the obnoxiously addicting party-song &ldquo;Dicke Titten Kartoffelsalat&rdquo; (Dutch for Big Tits and Potato Salad) on repeat around the grounds, it became clear that this is not your typical American motocross event. While the motocross race is the centerpiece of this festival, it&rsquo;s the 16 main stages and an endless flow of Grolsch beers that floated this one to 220,000+ attendees in 2016. About 300 Euro in Muntens, six carnival rides, and a few luckies later, the boys hit the sack just before sunrise and ready to put the #69 and #420 Kawi&rsquo;s to work.</p>\r\n<p>Pushing 30-degrees Celsius with 100 percent humidity, the festival packed in as the grounds quickly deteriorated; grass turning to dirt and an overwhelmingly heavy funk arising that falls somewhere between city dump and port-o-john. It&rsquo;s part of the experience&mdash;gross by U.S. terms, but perfectly acceptable in the name of rowdy partying in the Dutch countryside. On the track, motos included some conventional &ldquo;amateur&rdquo; style classes starting with 50cc&rsquo;s and ramping all the way up to marquee races like Heels on Wheels, Zwaargewichtklasse (party floats, soviet tanks, motorcycles&hellip;anything goes!) and the signature Superklasse where TB and DD were about to throw down.</p>\r\n<p>Bringing American riders to the ZwarteCross gets the crowd amped up. The sand tracks of Europe are different than the states and there&rsquo;s nothing Dutch fans love more than to see their local heroes go bar-to-bar with American motocross riders, on a course that the local advantage weighs heavy. Lining up for Moto one, Durham and Bereman both ripped mid-pack starts on top of Pirelli sand tires with 30,000 fans waiting to see what they could do. Durham mounted a charge early, ringing out his stock 450 and working his way into 8th place. With 2 laps to go and zero hours on the motor, seals started to give way and white smoke signaled impending doom. Shutting down on the last lap, Durham found his motor melted down and a DNF marking moto moto. Meanwhile, Bereman found himself recovering from a second-row start and working to find his flow in the deep sand but finishing the moto with confidence and good sprits.</p>\r\n<p>The following hours were tense as the boys promised to take it easy on the bikes, as DD&rsquo;s fresh 2017 was already toast. The mechanics huddled with the team owner and sourced a race bike for the morning. It was a gesture of support that showed the tradition of family is still alive here in Holland. The Fase&rsquo;s welcomed us in, and moved mountains to make sure that both Darryn and Tyler were taken care of.</p>\r\n<p>Suspense mounted with the afternoon heat as the 5:30 PM moto prepared to start. Back on the gate, Durham&rsquo;s #420 plates weren&rsquo;t the only hint to the smile on his face&mdash;he was back, ready to rip, and confident in the motorcycle beneath him. Holding a tight inside around he first corner and fighting for a 7th, Durham diced with regional and World Motocross pros into fourth or fifth position, while announcers in multiple languages belted out the play by play. Looking aggressive and confident, the fans lining the fence lines were treated to the kind of DD steeze the world hasn&rsquo;t seen since his last season racing U.S. Nationals. Just as podium contention started to become a reality, the announcers bellowed &ldquo;Darryn, get up Darryn!!!&rdquo; signaling that he had gone down, knifing the front end and remounting in mid pack just as his teammate Tyler Bereman made the move by. Watching the Americans battle side-by-side was the bittersweet reward of the moto, but nothing was as cool as seeing Darryn return to his signature form when the going got tough.</p>\r\n<p>As the sun set around 10:00 PM, the boys laced up their DC&rsquo;s and prepped for the many kilometers ahead, roaming the 137 acre festival grounds into the wee hours with friends they had yet to meet. With the Reggae tent at the top of the order, the night was young and the Muntens plentiful with one more day of racing on the agenda. Then after that&mdash;three days in Amsterdam&hellip; and perhaps the very last sighting of The Viewing Death Crue again as they disappear into the nooks and crannies of the Red Light District.</p>\r\n<p>Only time will tell how things go down, and the next installment of this blog to wrap up the rest of The Viewing&rsquo;s European adventure.

  {document_id: 75, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>In spite of having already done it once before, I was still nervous. But when Roland Sands and Cameron Brewer ask you if you want to ride a custom Roland Sands Designs Indian Scout in another Super Hooligan race at the second annual Lost Highway Show in San Bernardino, California, you don&rsquo;t pass it up.</p>\r\n<p>Held at the San Manuel Amphitheater just behind Glen Helen Raceway, this year&rsquo;s Lost Highway show featured a ton of bands, countless motorcycles on display, plenty of beer, and a Super Hooligan race presented by Roland Sands. Cut into a grass field in the middle of everything, the small Hooligan track was prepped and maintained by Speedway legend Brad Oxley and his crew, which included his sons&mdash;successful off-road racers that you&rsquo;ve likely heard of&mdash;Colton Udall and Ian Young.</p>\r\n<p>When I arrived, my anxiety peaked as I walked the track. On paper, riding on fresh grass sounds like any two-wheel enthusiast&rsquo;s dream, but when it comes down to it, grass is slicker than a whiskey fart on a hot summer day&mdash;especially when your bike is equipped with dirt track tires and no front brake. Oh, and it weighs over 500 pounds. Prior to practice, I tried to remind myself of the skills I learned during my first foray into the world of Hooligan competition in Las Vegas, and put it out of my mind that grass was going to make for an experience. And as it turned out, it didn&rsquo;t take long before things got interesting.</p>\r\n<p>As I sat waiting for my first practice session, I looked up just in time to see Cameron Brewer high-side into turn three and gracefully tuck and roll before popping up on his feet to push his bent up Harley off the track for repairs. But that was tame compared to what happened next. Right at the conclusion of the third session we all watched at Shawn Guardado went down in turn four before getting run over by another rider. As Shawn laid on the track motionless, everyone held their breath with a look on their faces, as if to say, &ldquo;This is going to be way&mdash;like a lot&mdash;sketchier than anticipated.&rdquo; Thankfully, Shawn got up with a smashed helmet and a bad concussion, but otherwise okay. While he walked past staging, I took a deep breath and prepared to pull out onto the track.</p>\r\n<p>I got a total of three sessions in&mdash;15 laps&mdash;before it was time to race, and thankfully I managed to get a little more comfortable with each outing. Even though Hooligan racing is intimidating, once you get the hang of it, it&rsquo;s a damn good time on a motorcycle. After trying to cool down in the 105-degree heat, I lined up for the first heat race, which when it was all said and done, turned out to be more of a battle of attrition than an actually race, as I was the only one left on two wheels after five red flag restarts. I guess you could say, I wasn&rsquo;t trying hard enough, but in reality, I didn&rsquo;t want to get any grass stains on my white jeans. My next race was the semi-finals, which didn&rsquo;t go as planned thanks to a horrible start, causing me to finish third, punching my ticket to the consolation race rather than the main event.</p>\r\n<p>My disappointment, though, quickly changed as I lined up next to Andy Bell. Decked out in his Canadian Tuxedo&mdash;denim vest and jeans&mdash;I knew we were going to have a good time. And after battling back and forth through five restarts, the green flag waved for the final time. I came into the first corner way too hot and directly at Bell. The resulting t-bone high-sided me into another rider, whom I bounced off of and proceeded to set my sights on Bell out front, but it was too late. After the numerous re-starts, I didn&rsquo;t have enough time left to catch Bell who was riding like a madman. With that, I sat on the sidelines and watched the finals with my wife and a cold beer.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, but I&rsquo;ll say it again, Hooligan racing has to be experienced to truly understand. On the surface, it looks like a bunch of&mdash;for lack of a better term&mdash;tattooed hooligans on heavy bikes being used in an application they weren&rsquo;t meant for. In reality, though, the camaraderie between the riders, the challenge of riding the heavy bikes on a dirt track, and the overall good time makes Hooligan racing one of my favorite things to do. As is the case with any form of motorcycle racing, Super Hooligan events bring out the best in people. And just like Steve McQueen said, &ldquo;Just when I think everything is wrong with the world, I come out here and see people having fun on motorcycles.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>By Brendan Lutes</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photos by Preston Burroughs</em></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

Captained by Darryn Durham and Tyler Bereman, the Viewing Death Crue is taking the roadshow global to wave the flag for professional funhavers worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>The destination: ZwarteCross, the only motocross race of it&rsquo;s kind that pulls elements of motocross racing, music festivals, and over the top misbehavior into a four-day format for the records books. Let it be known: Training for this event includes everything that a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; (a word we generally discourage) motocross racer should not. Beer drinking, crashing bonfires, road tripping with buddies, and a six-day bender at the annual Mammoth Motocross a couple weeks back have left everyone in prime shape for racing.</p>\r\n<p>Jetlag is a symptom best cured with a blast of adrenaline and 12oz coldie of your choice, so we pinned it south to Marmedy, Belgium, and rendezvoused with the Fest Series Loose Fest crew. Founded on similar ideals to The Viewing, the Fest Series riders are a worldwide band of freeride mountain bikers that are literally pushing the progression curve to vertical with massive jump lines, a jam-session format and content-driven approach that empowers rider&rsquo;s creativity and emphasis on radness.</p>\r\n<p>Loose Fest at BikePark Ferme Libert is perched upon the rolling hills of Hotel LeGrand Champs: A lodge befitting of the swiss alps (who also shares a last name of our filmer, with the infamous Mike &ldquo;Wu-Tang&rdquo; LeGrand) landscaped by endless rolling fields, dotted by deer, goats and the occasional roaming &ldquo;albino elk&rdquo;&hellip;we think. Darryn lead the 4AM charge to the &ldquo;Elk Barn&rdquo; but couldn&rsquo;t scale the double fences&hellip;the world may never know. Complete with a t-bar lift, the LooseFest course features an opening hit measuring out at 79 feet&mdash;that&rsquo;s 14 feet longer than a standard Supercross triple. Pushing 80 feet to clear the deck on a 20 foot tall bicycle landing is nothing short of mind-blowing, and when you add in motos, it&rsquo;s a recipe for pure space cake magic.</p>\r\n<p>Bereman is a two-time attendee of Cruz Fest, and he pulled immediate respect in his first year when he threw down Truckdriver grabs and a huuuuge NacNac that got away from him and robbed him of an ACL. In spite of that, though, he still managed to show up this year to take the game to the next level. Within an hour of watching the LooseFest mayhem begin, he geared up and cracked a couple whips in salute of a massive full moon that capped the trip in proper form. Durham, on the other hand was riding on a borrowed 2011 Yamaha replete with Kawasaki Rockstar logos on the shrouds. The first kick of the kickstarter snapped it off at the casting line. If that wasn&rsquo;t a sign, it&rsquo;s tank-like handling off the opening drop in line sealed the deal that he better save his magic for the fresh 2017&rsquo;s waiting for us at Zwartecross.</p>\r\n<p>This road report is coming to you from the back seat of a VW Minivan, ripping down the highway at about 30 km/h over the speed limit with ZwarteCross pinned on the GPS navigation. Dayle Dabblesworth still thinks he&rsquo;s on I-15 and his sketchy driving tactics made this story nearly impossible to write on the way, but we got it done to beam the good times back to the states where eager eyes await. Stay tuned for more and remember, you win some, you lose some and you wreck some&hellip;. so ya better make sure you&rsquo;re having the most fun, win, lose, or draw!</p>\r\n<p><em>Photos and Report by Aran Eversman</em></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

It&rsquo;s a profession that affords you the ability to make a living being creative, but more importantly doing something you love. For Derek Gibson, art has always been a passion of his, and through perseverance and hard work, he was able to combine painting with his other love of motocross.</p>\r\n<p>Over the years, Derek&rsquo;s skills with a brush and pen have allowed him the opportunity to paint during Supercross events, make some money, and donate his work for charity. With his art popping up all over the place, we decided to check in with him to get a little background on how he got into painting, motocross, and what led to him combining the two.</p>\r\n<p><b>How did you get started as an artist?</b></p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked to draw ever since I was a little kid. Right before racing the Millville Pro National, I had a serious head injury from a practice crash that pretty much put an end to my racing. So one day, I started drawing seriously to see what I could do with my artistic ability. Ever since that day, I&rsquo;ve put everything into my artwork so I wouldn&rsquo;t have any more regrets like I have with racing. Someday I want to be able to look at where I&rsquo;m at, good or bad, with my artwork and know I gave it everything I have.</p>\r\n<p><b>What do you enjoy most about painting?</b></p>\r\n<p>I enjoy putting a smile on someone&rsquo;s face when they see the end result of the artwork.</p>\r\n<p><b>Where do you look for inspiration?</b></p>\r\n<p>I get inspiration from the work of other artists. I always compare my work to theirs and want my stuff to be at their level someday.</p>\r\n<p><b>What do you enjoy most about art?</b></p>\r\n<p>The discipline it has taught me; it has taught me to stay focused. Seeing the rewards of the finished product, and hearing that others enjoy it, is very rewarding. It&rsquo;s also pretty rad when I get text messages and phone calls from some of the top pros in the sport of motocross wanting to have artwork done.</p>\r\n<p><b>What is your proudest accomplishment when it comes to painting?</b></p>\r\n<p>Getting to do interviews with companies like yours, and also being featured in the Five Minute Interview with Derek Gibson in <i>Racer X Magazine</i>. This Supercross season I also got to do artwork, of Jason Anderson, in the pits at the St. Louis round while sitting at the Rockstar Husqvarna semi. Another cool thing from my artwork is seeing my hard work pay off in the world of motocross/Supercross, and being able to donate my work and raise money for great causes and events. I also really enjoy getting to do artwork each year for the Legends and Heros Tour Hall of Fame Rider they have for opening ceremonies at Supercross.</p>\r\n<p><b>What are some goals you have for yourself?</b></p>\r\n<p>To be the best artist I can and to build a name for myself in the sport of motocross and action sports. I also want to grow as an artist, and hopefully be able to do my artwork full-time someday.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Derek's Social Media:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Instagram:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/derekgibson951/\">@derekgibson951</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Twitter:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/derekgibson951\">@derekgibson951</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>FaceBook:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/derek.gibson.9250\">Derek.Gibson</a></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

It brings riders out to compete aboard modified street bikes on flat tracks at interesting venues around The States. One racer that has been at it since the beginning is Jordan Graham. By day, he&rsquo;s a custom helmet painter for Airtrix Custom Paint, but on the weekends, he can be found sliding sideways aboard a 500-pound Roland Sands Designs Indian Scout. &ldquo;Most racing is too serious and no one has fun,&rdquo; Jordan said. &ldquo;At Hooligan races, though, everyone is having a good time while trying to avoid killing each other. It&rsquo;s rad to see how even the playing field is when everyone has no idea what a 500-pound motorcycle is about to do. It can tend to scare the shit out of people.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Witnessing a Hooligan event is one thing&mdash;carnage, near misses, and close racing are just some of the highlights&mdash;but racing one is a completely different animal all together. Getting into it, though, is usually as easy as finding a bike or modifying your own. &ldquo;I got into Hooligan racing after building a street tracker I used to ride to work,&rdquo; Jordan said. &ldquo;I signed up at a local flat track race with a group of other like-minded idiots, not knowing what we were about to get into. After my first high-side crash to my head, though, I knew I was addicted.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the unexpected, the good times, and the camaraderie with buddies that make Hooligan events one of our favorite forms of racing.</p>\r\n<p><em>Words and Photos by Brendan Lutes</em></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

  {document_id: 88, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>We begin this week on a somber note. Legendary filmmaker Bruce Brown passed away peacefully last night at his home in Santa Barbara, California. He was 80 years old.</p>\r\n<p>Bruce was an inspiration to generations of surfers, motorcyclists, and filmmakers. His numerous films provided an escape and glimpse into what we all love about what we now call action sports. His break-through film entitled <i>The Endless Summer</i> showed the public why surfing is so beloved by the diehard Southern Californian surfers, bringing the popular SoCal sport to the Midwest masses. <i>The Endless Summer</i> followed surfers around the world, as they chased perfect waves on picturesque beaches, and Bruce perfectly portrayed that lifestyle with his film. What started as a $50,000 investment by Bruce transformed into a national movement for the surfing community, and ultimately garnered millions of dollars at the box office.</p>\r\n<p>For motorcyclists, though, Bruce&rsquo;s next film <i>On Any </i>Sunday has stood the test time, inspiring generations of motorcycle riders by capturing the true essence of why we choose to twist the throttle&mdash;fun, camaraderie, and family. In the beginning, generating funding for the film proved difficult, but after a meeting with, Steve McQueen&mdash;who helped front the majority of the money needed&mdash;<i>On Any Sunday</i> gained the necessary backing for production. The film went on to garner an Academy Award Nomination for Best Documentary, and has since become an iconic piece of motorcycling history. In the years following the release of <em>On Any Sunday</em>, follow-up films have been produced. Most recently, Bruce's son Dana produced <em>On Any Sunday: The Next Chapter</em>, which was released in 2014.</p>\r\n<p>Here at Fasthouse, Bruce was a friend and he will be missed dearly. When we produced the <i>Day In The Dirt</i> film back in 2002, during the fourth DITD event, Bruce graciously allowed never-before-seen footage from <i>On Any Sunday </i>to be used in the film. Bruce will forever be remember for his film legacy, but he will also be remember for the amazing man he was. Godspeed, Bruce.</p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

Held over the course of a week, Rampage pits mountain biking&rsquo;s best free ride athletes against each other on arguably the gnarliest course on the planet, as riders navigate sheer cliffs, and massive gaps, at nearly incomprehensible speeds.</p>\r\n<p>In a last-minute wild card entry, Fasthouse&rsquo;s first MTB athlete Ryan &ldquo;R-Dog&rdquo; Howard spent nearly two weeks in Utah, preparing his run and getting acquainted with the treacherous terrain. Styling in some of our moto gear, R-Dog held his own, as he completed two solid runs with rad style and soul. Following his final run&mdash;and with an ice-cold beer in hand&mdash;R-Dog had this to say in the finishing corral. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so honored to be a part of this event, and rep the Fasthouse gear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to win this thing, I&rsquo;m here to show people what riding bikes is all about! Hanging with the boys, laying down a couple runs, and crackin' a beer to celebrate the good times.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>R-Dog&rsquo;s fun-loving attitude is contagious&mdash;good times, throwing whips, and laughing with buddies is what MTB and moto are all about. And since inking his FH deal, we&rsquo;ve known he was a perfect fit. &ldquo;The first time I met Kenny [Alexander], we were talking about big events like Rampage,&rdquo; R-Dog said. &ldquo;I told him that I&rsquo;m not the most competitive person, and he didn&rsquo;t seem to care.

Over the years, we've been lucky enough to have Runyard share his memories and some of his pricelss photos from his racing days. Following his racing career, he transitioned into Hollywood stunts where he became one of the most well-respected stuntmen in the industry.

Below are some memories that Runyard wrote for us.</p>\r\n<p><em>Photo 1: Here I am getting the holeshot at the Unadilla Trans-Am in 1974. Runyard (6), Roger DeCoster (69), Jim Pomeroy (12), Bengt Aberg (11), Jan-Eric Sallqvist (25), Raymond Boven (10).</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photo 2: Roger DeCoster setting me up for a pass just before the right hand turn down the Cork Screw Hill for the u-turn left, I beat him to the bottom, but he braked early and tucked inside at the bottom and passed me going up Cork Screw Hill at the Unadilla Trans-Am in 1974. Lesson learned, thank you Roger, we laughed later&mdash;at least I did&mdash;he just smiled. He was fast, and had great cornering speed just like Ryan Dungy.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photo 3: Trans-Am Lexington, Ohio (Mid-Ohio) in 1973. This photo has an interesting story. Mostly all the tracks where natural terrain, even Mid-Ohio, except this year. In this long sweeping turn before the uphill to the finish line, they had built these three humps, and the third one&mdash;that you cannot see in this photo&mdash;is farther apart than the first two. For the most part, everybody was just jumping the first two. My Mom took this photo during the last practice, and prior to it, she told me that Heikki Mikola had just jumped all three. On the last lap, I waited for him to go by and had to ride like hell for a lap to try and keep up with him. Look at all the people watching him do this jump. If you look right behind the guy in Honda shirt and the guy in the Yamaha shirt, both the team racing managers, you can see me watching Heikki do this. I did not start jumping all three until the second moto.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photo 4: Here&rsquo;s another photo that my Mom took. It&rsquo;s Gary Jones the 1972 Inter-Am 250 in Boise, Idaho. This was the Longest and Steepest downhill that we ever raced. It was steeper than Mammoth and four times longer. You could still go pretty fast, though, because it was soft and deep. Look at all the different lines we made.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photo 5: These results were from the Evel Knievel Snake River race. Check out the prize money; that was big prize money for back then. The interesting story here was that after we finished the races, we had a jump contest, and I went second to last in full motocross gear. I went into the lead going nine feet farther than anybody else. The last guy to jump was Kenny Zahrt. He pulled up to the starting spot with a t-shirt on, a pair of jeans, and I swear to God he was wearing a pair of Hush puppies for shoes. He proceeded to blow all of us off, going 18 feet further than me. I don&rsquo;t think he even raced that day and I think he borrowed a 360 Bultaco from either Tom Rapp or Ron Pomeroy. We all laughed and congratulated him. He rang that Bultaco out, shifting gears all the way to the take off ramp and he flew so far&mdash;it was beautiful.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photo 6: I found another photo that my Mom took at WestLake on a Montesa. Not sure what year this was&mdash;1968 to 1971? I don&rsquo;t know if the photo is damaged from old age, the light, the exposure, or dust?</em></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

Legends were made and unforgettable moments were etched into history through events that included the Trans AMA, Outdoor Motocross Nationals, World Mini GP, Flat Track races, and even some BMX events. Unfortunately, Saddleback was closed in 1984 due to liability lawsuits, and for the most part there isn&rsquo;t much left, as the 241 Toll Road now runs through a portion of it.

Over the past few years, Alta has been making major strides in manufacturering a race-ready electric motocross bike. And after spending numerous days at the track with the Alta crew, Darryn Durham decided to put the machine to the test, racing in the annual TransWorld Motocross Slam event at Milestone MX Park. The Slam race is unlike any other, pitting 10 top pros against each other in two five-lap motos with the winner taking the $5,000 lion's share of the $10,000 pro purse. Practice for DD went relatively smoothly, as he went down a couple times while pushing the proverbial envelope aboard the Redshift, but in the end, he made it into the main event. Against the 10 other gas powered MX bikes, Darryn held his own, stayed out of trouble—for the most part—and turned in a solid finish in the Redshift's first official motocross race. The Redshift stood up to the abuse, proving that the future looks bright for the electric movement.

  {document_id: 32, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>When I was a kid, my entire family would pile into our Mini Wini, with the flatbed trailer in tow, bound for a weekend in the wide-open Southern California Mojave Desert. Trips like that were some of the best memories of my childhood&mdash;trying to look like my heroes while I chased my dad over the rocks, whoops, and sand. I still remember the day that we stopped on the side of the trail&mdash;I was on my CR80; my dad aboard his KDX200&mdash;and he said to me with honest excitement in his voice, &ldquo;Wow, you&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; fast. Every time I looked back to check on you, you were right behind me.&rdquo; As the years went on, I progressed, racing took over, I soon went off to college, and our regular trail riding trips became fewer and fewer. But to this day, every time we get a chance to ride together, I never pass it up. Riding with my dad is one of coolest things I get to do on a motorcycle. And when we got the invite from our good friends Larry Atnip and Massis Chahbazian to attend the annual Best In The Desert Nevada 200 Trail Ride, we couldn&rsquo;t pass it up.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nevada Trail Ride has been going on for over 30 years. Originally promoted and organized by the late Casey Folks, along with his son Darryl and off-road legend Scott Harden, the ride covers 200 miles of picturesque Nevada terrain just north of Las Vegas, and as an invite-only ride, the number of riders is usually kept at the perfect amount for the miles of single-track trails and abundant good times. Since I wanted to enjoy every moment of the ride, though, I decided to leave my professional camera behind&mdash;something that was tough to do&mdash;and just enjoy the experience with my dad, stopping only to bench race, drink some water, and take casual cell phone pictures.</p>\r\n<p>Being that it was our first year attending for my dad and I, we didn&rsquo;t really know what to expect, but as I drove to the small town of Caliente on the first day to meet up with my dad and everyone else, I began to climb over the mountain that led into town, and the snow on the ground became more and more abundant. After checking in, we unloaded our bikes, geared up, and attended the rider&rsquo;s meeting before embarking on the first day of riding, which was without a doubt going to be cold and interesting.</p>\r\n<p>My dad and I left base camp together and rode down a transfer road with everyone else before jumping into a soft snow covered sand wash. Having little to no experience in the snow, I watched my dad in front of me pinned aboard his CRF250R with his feet off the pegs, paddling through the snow, and I thought to myself, &ldquo;Wow, if this is how difficult snow is, this is going to be quite the day&hellip;&rdquo; But after a couple falls, and stopping to put on some rubber gloves to keep my hands warm, the sandy trail soon wound into single track through the trees. After that, the entire day was spent cutting in fresh tracks and enjoying the scenery. With that said, though, the day wasn&rsquo;t without sketchy moments. If I got out of the main line, I found myself all over the countryside on more than one occasion, bouncing off rocks like a ping-pong ball. I also got the chance to see a guy wrap himself around a tree after he hit a hidden rock, swapped out, and promptly high-sided directly into the side of an immoveable nearby tree. It all goes into what makes trail riding so fun. As long as you can laugh about it later, it was a good idea.</p>\r\n<p>The next day, we woke up bright and early to blue bird conditions and perfect springtime temperatures. But while I shoveled in some fresh scrambled eggs with everyone else at the local American Legion Post, I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder how muddy it would get once the snow began to melt. As we made our way into the mountains during the first part of the day, we wound through perfect desert single track. After hitting the gas stop, though, the conditions changed drastically, as we began to hit melting snow and supremely muddy conditions in the higher elevations. Being that we&rsquo;re all from California, the mud was nothing short of a challenge, and I followed behind my dad during the final 20 miles before lunch. Every time we stopped to regroup, he kept asking if I wanted to pass, but I never did. Instead I decided to keep a safe distance back in order to watch what lines he took or where the rocks were to miss. Basically, if he got loose&mdash;and he definitely did a few times&mdash;I knew not to take that line. Sorry Dad, but just like when I was on my 80, you were the trail guinea pig. After miles of sloppy mud, we made it to lunch with huge smiles on our muddy faces, thankful to get a break and a chance to bull shit with everyone else.</p>\r\n<p>Arguably the coolest aspect of the ride is the camaraderie, which is very apparent at the lunch stop during the second day. Out in the middle of nowhere, the BITD crew organized a fully catered lunch, and before you even eat, you grab a hot towel to clean up with and play a hand of electronic poker, which the winner is announced at the wrap-up dinner later that night. Everyone sat at the tables, ate homemade pulled-pork sandwiches, and bench raced about the first half of the day. And once our stomachs were full, causing a few guys some unpleasant heartburn for the last section, we jumped on our bikes for the final 20 miles back to town.</p>\r\n<p>That night, the annual Easter Egg Run was held right before dinner followed by the hilariously entertaining Whistle Dick awards. If you&rsquo;ve ever been to a Best In The Desert event, you&rsquo;ve likely heard BITD founder Casey Folks lovingly&mdash;or not so lovingly&mdash;refer to people who make dumb decisions as &ldquo;whistle dicks&rdquo;. This year, in keeping with Casey&rsquo;s fun-loving award ceremony, his son Darryl and Scott Harden did the honors on Casey&rsquo;s behalf, awarding various riders with a small pink whistle dick for their actions over the past couple days. Each award was just as funny as the previous, and everyone drank beer, laughed, and had a good time the only way Casey would have wanted it&mdash;a bunch of motorcycle riders making fun of each other.</p>\r\n<p>When I sit back and think about where I&rsquo;ve been because of motorcycles, none of it has been as cool as the times I&rsquo;ve spent with my dad&mdash;either chasing him or him chasing me. Since I first started riding, he has been by my side through it all and even though neither of us are as quick as we used to be, or get to ride together as often as we used to, twisting the throttle, throwing mud, and laughing still is at the top of my list of things I love to do with my dad. Getting the opportunity to participate in the Nevada Trail ride was rad, and as long as my dad or I can lift our legs over the top of a dirt bike, we&rsquo;ll be attending.

My first goal was to obviously make it to the night show, which I did. My second goal was to complete all the laps that I could, and if I made the main, that would be great. But I just wanted to complete as many laps as I could. I&rsquo;m just focused on making improvements for next weekend and continue getting better.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What was the biggest surprise of the weekend?</strong></p>\r\n<p>There really weren&rsquo;t any big surprises.

I just have to get a good start.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Was it a surreal feeling to walk into the stadium for the first time?</strong></p>\r\n<p>It was definitely a surreal moment when I first walked into the stadium for track walk.

I&rsquo;ve done Monster Cup for the past five years, but there&rsquo;s nothing like racing Supercross in Anaheim&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing like it. Monster Cup is a cool learning experience, and it gets you prepared for all the people in the stadium, but racing actual Supercross in Anaheim is a different feeling&mdash;in a better way. It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are some of the goals that you&rsquo;ve set for yourself?</strong></p>\r\n<p>For me to just progress every weekend; I want to make the main consistently; and get myself up there with those top guys to see what I can do.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Being 17 is pretty young to turn pro, right?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a young age and everyone always asks me that. At this point, I feel really comfortable in Supercross, and I had more to gain than lose if I stayed in amateurs for another year.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Any crazy things happen to you during the weekend? Any fans ask you to sign anything weird?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Hopefully if I make it in the main I&rsquo;ll get to sign some cool stuff (laughs), but there were a few people that came over. It was a cool experience to get to sign some autographs&mdash;some young kids and older people that didn&rsquo;t really know anything about motocross. That was really cool. I had a decent get-off in practice, which didn&rsquo;t really set me back, but it was scary. I went over the bars and had to regroup from that one. Other than that, I had a great experience racing my first Supercross. I&rsquo;m looking forward to San Diego.</p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

  {document_id: 62, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>It&rsquo;s been over 10 years since I&rsquo;ve attended a professional motocross race as a spectator behind the fence line and in the beer line. I&rsquo;ve been traveling the world as a motocross photographer and magazine editor for my entire post-college adult life. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s been great&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen and done more things than most people get to do in a lifetime. I&rsquo;ve tested factory bikes, gone for a ride in Chad Reed&rsquo;s rally car, ridden the Motocross of Nations track&mdash;in France&mdash;the day after Dungey and Villopoto clinched the championship, visited some of the most iconic tracks around the world, gotten to know many of the sports greatest riders&hellip; that&rsquo;s just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. But what I haven&rsquo;t done is enjoy a foot-long hot dog and ice-cold beer while dodging roost and hanging over the trackside fence at a National or Grand Prix.</p>\r\n<p>With the Glen Helen USGP slated for this past weekend, and no real reason for me to trudge around all day, snapping endless photos, I decided it was the perfect opportunity to experience motocross the way it should be. Like a true spectator, I didn&rsquo;t even have access to the pits&mdash;just a regular general admission wristband, because lets be honest, pit passes are expensive. I still slung my trusty camera over my shoulder, though, only this time I put on one short lens&mdash;no 300mm 2.8 or quiver of various lenses weighing me down&mdash;just my camera in one hand and a frothy beer in the other. What I found was that I still love this sport of motocross just as much as my 12-year-old self, and that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve become a little jaded by all the glitz and glamour of the professional racing scene; all the long nights of writing race reports and editing photos have worn me down and diminished my enthusiasm for watching dirt bikes. But getting to be a fan again showed me the energy and excitement that&rsquo;s in the crowd, and that standing in the heat and dust all day is actually quite fun. It reminded me what the sport of motocross is all about&mdash;battling the elements, conquering fears, overcoming hardships, but most of all, fun.</p>\r\n<p>In the second moto, as Eli Tomac made his way to the front from a horrible start, the crowd erupted every time he went by&mdash;beer spilling, roost flying, and air horns blasting. It was truly cool soaking it all in, wandering around with my wife and buddies, as we looked for the next gnarly spot to watch the riders navigate. Standing back and observing from a perspective that I&rsquo;m not used to provided a new perspective on everything. I did get into the pits for a brief second, though, thanks to a buddy (whom shall remain nameless) who loaned me his wristband. Racing is badass, and I&rsquo;m going to be reliving this day where I didn&rsquo;t bother getting the all access photo pass, but instead roamed around the track, snapping photos that told the story of my day and the fun we all had at the races. We didn&rsquo;t necessarily care too much about missing great passes or insane battles. The day was all about watching some of the world&rsquo;s best riders tackle one of the world&rsquo;s toughest tracks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>MXGP</strong></p>\r\n<p>1.

  {document_id: 63, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>In spite of a couple crashes that kept my seat time to a minimum this year, I&rsquo;ve been riding a lot over the past few weeks, and I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; good. &ldquo;We race&hellip; sometimes.&rdquo; A joking moniker that became a serious reality of 2016, thanks in part to those crashes, has somehow become the theme of 2016 for me. We've been hard at work riding, racing sometimes, and filming all of it for an upcoming four-part series dubbed, \"We Race, Sometimes.\" It's action-packed with freeriding, fun, and \"sometimes\" racing. Be on the look out for the first video to drop in the coming weeks. For now, I just wanted to get you caught up on what&rsquo;s been going on.</p>\r\n<p>I've had a loose, yet serious, outlook on racing since I was a kid&mdash;I always have fun with it. When I was younger, my brother was the fast one, and I was the goof off who was doing tricks and chasing chicks. But even after all these years, when I really think about it, I'm starting to realize that I'm still exactly the same. After 25 years of racing, earning a lifetime AMA membership, and having more good times than I can remember, this party is just getting started! Over the past few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been back home&mdash;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefasthouse.com/the-scene/articles/home-sweet-home-durham-returns-to-pa\">which I wrote about last week</a>&mdash;enjoying some family time and a little racing.</p>\r\n<p>This past Saturday, we went riding at Rick Kresic's track out by the Pittsburgh Airport. While we were there, a friend mentioned a money race at Briarcliff in Ohio. It sounded like a good idea, so I went home, prepped the bikes, and left at 4:00 AM the next morning to make it in time for the two-lap practice sessions. Luckily the races were long, as I had to learn the track on the fly since it was my first time there. It was a great layout with some of the best dirt I have ridden anywhere in the country. I was able to win all four motos, and our cameraman Mike even hit the track for the 125cc Legends race, and promptly faded like a black T-shirt out there!</p>\r\n<p>The next morning, I went on an epic mountain bike ride with my brother Shane. I figured out quickly, though, that he wanted to kick my ass, as he turned up the heat on the trails at North Park. If that wasn't enough to be sore, the next day I jumped on the road bike with Broc Hepler to tag along as he preps for the International Six Day Enduro next month. After all that, I have to be getting in shape. More importantly, though, all that training earned a couple cold ones with Mike. Just as the brews cracked, and we began to relax at Mike&rsquo;s house, his Mom said she had free Kennywood tickets&mdash;one of the oldest amusement parks in America. Without hesitation, we pounded our drinks and headed out the door for Kennywood.</p>\r\n<p>Opening in 1899, my favorite rides are the old wooden coasters built almost 100 years ago. The Jack Rabbit was built in 1920 and has a double dip where I swear the coaster gets some hang time. Another ride dubbed The Racer was built in 1927 and has two coasters racing side-by-side all the way to the finish. The craziest part, though, is that if you start on the left side, you end on the right, meaning somehow the train switches sides&mdash;I still haven't figured it out. It was a weekday, so the lines were short and we had a blast. If you're ever in Pittsburgh and someone hollers Kennywood's open! Check your zipper.</p>\r\n<p>I'm only home a few more days before I head back to race the 125 Dream Race aboard the Hell Raiser 125 built by Jeske MX Customs. The bike looks badass and I'm excited to line up for my first-ever 125 race! I might have to dust off the old Honda of Troy 125 for a few laps this week. We&rsquo;re headed up to the Pacific Northwest next Wednesday, and we&rsquo;ll be documenting the whole trip and posting updates along the way.

The bravado it takes to successfully navigate one of these heavy bikes around a slick dirt track is not only impressive to watch, but it&rsquo;s also thoroughly entertaining. During this year&rsquo;s annual motorcycle pilgrimage to Sturgis, Roland Sands and Indian helped to put on one of the coolest races at the rally.</p>\r\n<p>Held at the huge Buffalo Chip Campgrounds, the Super Hooligan race, which also featured a pro flat track class, drew a huge crowd of spectators and riders to witness racing on a track that was laid out on the concert grounds; right in front of the stage where Willy Nelson, Lynard Skynard, Elle King, Weird Al Yankovic, and more were slated to perform later in the evening. While not everyone at Fasthouse was lucky enough to attend, our friend Chris Sackett from Bell Helmets made the trek to try his hand at Hooligan racing aboard a RSD Yamaha Bolt. And Leticia Cline spun some laps decked out in her FH gear. All told, the race was a resounding success in spite of the rain that fell prior.

  {document_id: 65, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>There&rsquo;s really nothing quite like getting back to our roots to race motorcycles with our buddies. And when Hell On Wheels decided to throw their Hot August Nights flat track race at Industry Hills Speedway this past weekend, we couldn&rsquo;t pass up the good time. What&rsquo;s better than strapping on a helmet, bringing just about any bike you want&mdash;including a smoke-belching three-wheeler if that's your thing&mdash;and throwing it sideways into the first corner? Aside from activities that are barely legal, there&rsquo;s not much that can top an evening of holding it wide, getting sketchy, and laughing every step of the way.</p>\r\n<p>After a brief rider&rsquo;s meeting, the evening started at around 6:00 with practice followed by heat races and main events. Hell On Wheels&rsquo; laid-back founder &ldquo;Meatball&rdquo; always puts on relaxed, fun events and this one was no exception. There was plenty of downtime to bullshit with buddies, check out the eclectic assortment of bikes, and partake in some cold ones if you weren&rsquo;t racing. On the track, the action was extremely entertaining&mdash;paint was traded, parts were bent, and egos were undoubtedly bruised after some of the crashes we witnessed. Our Fasthouse crew also made quite the impression over the course of the event, with a huge presence in the pits that included dirt bikes from just about every era and plenty of cold 805s in our ice chest.</p>\r\n<p>Decked out in the White Lightning jerseys&mdash;which have become an HoW tradition for us&mdash;the FH crew was either consistently up front or consistently having the most fun on the track. Tyler Bereman even raced with a cast on his left arm from a fresh break a few weeks ago, and in every race, he&rsquo;d somehow would &ldquo;not notice the checkered flag&rdquo; so he could sneak in a few extra laps. TB&rsquo;s dad Randy also made the drive from up north to race with his son, bringing out his immaculate Bultaco dirt track bike, aboard which he displayed some picture-perfect flat track style on his way to victory. He wasn&rsquo;t the only podium finisher in our group, though, as Brendan Lutes took the Vintage Class win, FH head honcho Kenny Alexander finished third in vintage, TB took the Mini Bike victory, Wacker finished second in Bomber, and Matt Cerami took second in the Modern Class. We definitely conquered the circle track, logging countless laps and dusting a case or two of 805s while smiling the entire time. Here&rsquo;s to the next time we get to have a good time at one of the Hell On Wheels&rsquo; events.

  {document_id: 66, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>Ever since Tony Jeske of Jeske MX Customs built a fully custom YZ125 for The 1 Moto show earlier this year, everyone was left wondering if it was built to rip or just built to be a piece of art. We&rsquo;re happy to report that along with Tony, we&rsquo;ve had big plans to race the beautiful machine dubbed Hell Raiser at the upcoming 125 Dream Race at Washougal MX Park in Washougal, Washington, on September 17<sup>th</sup>-18<sup>th</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>Since the beginning, Jeske has always wanted the bike to hit the dirt, and the plan has been to get a Fasthouse rider to compete aboard it. As luck would have it, with the Dream Race rapidly approaching, Darryn Durham&rsquo;s hectic schedule opened up, making him the easy choice as the rider lucky enough to put Hell Raiser&rsquo;s knobbies in the dirt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m super excited to ride it,&rdquo; Durham said. &ldquo;The bike is a work of art, so I&rsquo;m excited to hit the dirt for the first time and tear it up.&rdquo; Surprisingly enough, even though Durham has a 125 of his own back home in Pennsylvania, he has never lined up behind a gate aboard it. &ldquo;I got a 125 about five or six years ago just for fun, and I love riding it. I think riding 125s makes you a better four-stroke rider. I&rsquo;ve put some time in on it, but I&rsquo;ve never really raced a 125 before, so this will be my first ever 125 race.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As for the bike, Jeske built it almost on a whim. When invited to show a bike at the prestigious 1 Moto Show in Portland this year, Jeske didn&rsquo;t have a plan or a bike. But after procuring a YZ125 from local Portland dealership Power Motorsports, he decided to go all out, creating the Hell Raiser to drop jaws and get people talking about what a truly custom motorcycle is all about. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a 125 and it can scream,&rdquo; Tony said of the beautiful machine he created. &ldquo;The name has a purpose. I&rsquo;m stirring up a little bit of hell. What&rsquo;s wrong with being a little bit of a menace? That&rsquo;s kind of where my head was at when I sat down to design this bike. I want to grow my shop [Jeske MX Customs] and do things for a reason. I wanted to be different, raise some hell, and make a statement.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In only a couple short weeks, the Fasthouse crew will be making the trek up to Washington to do just that&mdash;make a statement with Durham screaming Jeske&rsquo;s Hell Raiser up the hills of Washougal. But according to Durham, he still has one thing to learn&hellip;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna have to figure out if it&rsquo;s a first or second gear start (laughs).&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Pacific Northwest better watch out&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>If you want to see Durham ripping his personal 125, check out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdTjP43R6Ck\">THIS VIDEO</a>.

  {document_id: 67, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>Sometimes you just have to get back to your roots. After being on the road all year, Mike LeGrand and I loaded up the van to head east for one more cross-country adventure&mdash;this time to Pennsylvania for some family time, good riding, and good times.</p>\r\n<p>Driving straight through the midnight storms, we finally arrived at Mike's at 7:00AM. And after spending months without his girls&mdash;and by girls, I mean bikes&mdash;Mike immediately woke up his Mom and started putting his bike together for an afternoon of riding with the boys at our local riding spot called Switchback. We had a ripping crew of riders and the track was a radical change from California&mdash;no hard-packed blue groove, just plenty of traction. There's nothing like a day of riding with your buds! It was my first time riding with my brothers Shane and B-rad in a couple years, so it felt like a family reunion on the track. Motorcycles are in the blood for our tight crew.</p>\r\n<p>After riding, I headed over to my Grandma's for dinner. I was greeted with my littlest brother Isaiah, already in his riding gear, as he ran to the garage stoked to show me that he could now start his 50. I hooked him up with a new set of goggles, which he broke in properly by burning a track in Grammy's lawn before dark. Needless to say, she wasn&rsquo;t too thrilled, but Isaiah had one hell of a time. Just as the sun went down, my Mom hollered us in for dinner, as it was time to share stories and eat some home cooked goodness with the fam.</p>\r\n<p>As if that wasn't enough for the first day, right after dinner we heard about a big \"field party\" going on that night in my hometown. Without hesitation, we grabbed the cameras and piled in the van to check it out. We pulled up to over 300 people jamming to a cover band on a makeshift stage. The best part, a slip-n-slide going right down to the front of the stage. The beer was flowing like water, which to our delight, resulted in a ladies topless slide-off, proving to me, that American's go harder than any other country we've been to this year&mdash;including Amsterdam.</p>\r\n<p>The next morning, I headed over to the PR2 Race Shop for some bike prep and to see my Pops. I was drenched in sweat from changing tires in the summer heat when he showed up and gave me a hug. He then promptly told me to get a job... Little does he know, my life is a traveling circus, and when I heard that the Hookstown Fair was throwing another race, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to put in a little work. To which he replied with a laugh, \"Oh yeah, you raced there in &lsquo;96 on a 50.\" I couldn't really remember the race, but twenty years later, I was stoked to be going back!</p>\r\n<p>As we were pulling into the fairgrounds for the race, the memories started rolling back. And then... I saw the Arena. It was much smaller than I remembered, but when I saw the grandstands the memories of racing as a kid came flooding back! I even remembered &ldquo;Mad Mike&rdquo; Jones winning that night in baggy gear on a number 52 Kawi! As it turned out, the evening was just as fun as I remembered. I lined up for the flag start right after the ATV Pro Main and greased my way to a win. After the checkered flag waved and the champagne sprayed, I took my winnings straight over for a lemonade and a stuffed animal, but Dale the Carny ripped me off for five bucks. Frustrated and still in my gear, I hit a couple rides and left my mark on the annual Hookstown Fair.</p>\r\n<p>I've only been home a few days, but it's already been a great trip. More rain, more riding, and more ridiculousness coming next week! Stay tuned! Mike is hard at work on a video, and we still have more good times ahead.</p>\r\n<p>Rubber side down!</p>\r\n<p><em>Words by Darryn Durham</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photos by Mike LeGrand and Tommy White</em></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

While working his way into fourth in Saturday&rsquo;s motos, Durham caught is knee on a deep inside rut, twisting it until feeling a pop, claiming the Medial Collateral Ligament along the way. With a stiff hobble made worse by eight-plus kilometers of walking the night before, the decision was made to ride opening ceremonies, pop some wheelies, and call it a wrap with some decent mobility still in play while Tyler Bereman carried the torch for &lsquo;Merica in the final motos. Also onboard with TB was Yumi&mdash;The Viewing&rsquo;s beloved Burnt Toast movie extra and portable blow up doll with &ldquo;luscious&rdquo; lips&hellip; and uh, other parts as was claimed on the box she arrived in.</p>\r\n<p>With &ldquo;Dicke Titten Kartoffelsalat&rdquo; blaring over the loudspeakers and drunken, cheering Euros lining every inch of fence, the parade lap commenced. Durham was to escort &ldquo;Fatty Patty&rdquo; on the front of the 420 machine, but she clipped a foot on the exhaust pipe and deflated, abandoned in the staging area watching her friends ride off into the fray. Along with European Von Zipper Freewheeler Tristan Purdin, they roosted the shit out of raging fans, popped wheelies, and made an epic toss out for the fans, sending Yumi onto the next chapter of her illustrious life.</p>\r\n<p>After Tyler clipped the gate hinge from a second row start, he was awarded with the worst start of his career, but he still put his head down and got to work.

Decked out in fresh American gear from Fasthouse, DC, and Vonzipper, they stuck out like sore thumbs as they hit the streets in search of smoke-filled coffee shops, good times, and the finest pleasures that the city might have to offer. Over three days, the crew discovered art by Banksy, plentiful pre-rolls, catcalling women yelling, &ldquo;Blondie!&rdquo; to Bereman, espresso and truffles, and best of all&hellip; English speaking humans. Slightly intimidated by streets and buildings built in the early 1500&rsquo;s that are best navigated by bikes, it was exactly the cultural trip they&rsquo;d been hoping for. Amsterdam is a place best experienced rather than told about. While semi-legal weed and sinful sex are the lead-offs to every foreigner&rsquo;s Amsterdam tale, there&rsquo;s much more to the city than relaxed rules. It&rsquo;s a cultural melting pot, teeming with life and stories of self-expression that does not exist in the United States. Things in America are too new, too sanitized, and too politically correct.

A couple years ago, while Fasthouse was steadily gaining notoriety&mdash;and the jerseys were cranking out and selling like hot cakes&mdash;Sean Collier got an invite to race with the Ox Motorsports team aboard their CRF450X at the annual Glen Helen 24 Hour event. Without hesitation, he took the invite, and we set up camp in the pits&mdash;in true FH style of course with an Airstream, tasty BBQ, and ice cold brews&mdash;in order to document the race in its entirety.</p>\r\n<p>What transpired was a story that has to be seen to fully understand. The race itself didn&rsquo;t go as planned for the foursome of Colton Udall, Ian Young, Mark Samuels, and Sean Collier, but it wasn&rsquo;t for lack of trying or preparation. Bad luck hindered them the entire 24 hours, relegating them to a runner-up finish.

  {document_id: 74, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>Our last entry signed off from the backseat of a Volkswagen mini van bound for ZwarteCross, where The Viewing&rsquo;s Darryn &amp; Tyler arrived a mere 20 minutes later to a giant-faced man, extremely upset by their lack of credentials and a mean u-turn over a double white line that seemed perfectly kosher to those of us from the states. In a land where everyone speaks multiple languages and we&rsquo;re stuck using hand signals and words like &ldquo;no understando&rdquo;, they quickly realized that the joke is on Americans when it comes to traveling overseas.</p>\r\n<p>In the riders paddock stood a lone race transporter: A badass flat front semi in full World Motocross dress. Darryn and Tyler were about to find themselves back in the factory saddle pitting out of the &uuml;ber-plush F&amp;H Kawasaki rig. Owned by the Harry Fase and his family, they made sure we were comfortable and introduced their new, awkward American friends to the family. Sending them towards the festival grounds with a knowing smile, they knew that there was no preparing for the weirdness ahead. Exchanging cash for Muntens and hopping bar to bar, the boys found themselves in a surreal world of LARPers, post-apocalyptic death machines, deep house music, and drag queens in a true cultural melting pot&mdash;no quarter asked and none given. Pumping the obnoxiously addicting party-song &ldquo;Dicke Titten Kartoffelsalat&rdquo; (Dutch for Big Tits and Potato Salad) on repeat around the grounds, it became clear that this is not your typical American motocross event. While the motocross race is the centerpiece of this festival, it&rsquo;s the 16 main stages and an endless flow of Grolsch beers that floated this one to 220,000+ attendees in 2016. About 300 Euro in Muntens, six carnival rides, and a few luckies later, the boys hit the sack just before sunrise and ready to put the #69 and #420 Kawi&rsquo;s to work.</p>\r\n<p>Pushing 30-degrees Celsius with 100 percent humidity, the festival packed in as the grounds quickly deteriorated; grass turning to dirt and an overwhelmingly heavy funk arising that falls somewhere between city dump and port-o-john. It&rsquo;s part of the experience&mdash;gross by U.S. terms, but perfectly acceptable in the name of rowdy partying in the Dutch countryside. On the track, motos included some conventional &ldquo;amateur&rdquo; style classes starting with 50cc&rsquo;s and ramping all the way up to marquee races like Heels on Wheels, Zwaargewichtklasse (party floats, soviet tanks, motorcycles&hellip;anything goes!) and the signature Superklasse where TB and DD were about to throw down.</p>\r\n<p>Bringing American riders to the ZwarteCross gets the crowd amped up. The sand tracks of Europe are different than the states and there&rsquo;s nothing Dutch fans love more than to see their local heroes go bar-to-bar with American motocross riders, on a course that the local advantage weighs heavy. Lining up for Moto one, Durham and Bereman both ripped mid-pack starts on top of Pirelli sand tires with 30,000 fans waiting to see what they could do. Durham mounted a charge early, ringing out his stock 450 and working his way into 8th place. With 2 laps to go and zero hours on the motor, seals started to give way and white smoke signaled impending doom. Shutting down on the last lap, Durham found his motor melted down and a DNF marking moto moto. Meanwhile, Bereman found himself recovering from a second-row start and working to find his flow in the deep sand but finishing the moto with confidence and good sprits.</p>\r\n<p>The following hours were tense as the boys promised to take it easy on the bikes, as DD&rsquo;s fresh 2017 was already toast. The mechanics huddled with the team owner and sourced a race bike for the morning. It was a gesture of support that showed the tradition of family is still alive here in Holland. The Fase&rsquo;s welcomed us in, and moved mountains to make sure that both Darryn and Tyler were taken care of.</p>\r\n<p>Suspense mounted with the afternoon heat as the 5:30 PM moto prepared to start. Back on the gate, Durham&rsquo;s #420 plates weren&rsquo;t the only hint to the smile on his face&mdash;he was back, ready to rip, and confident in the motorcycle beneath him. Holding a tight inside around he first corner and fighting for a 7th, Durham diced with regional and World Motocross pros into fourth or fifth position, while announcers in multiple languages belted out the play by play. Looking aggressive and confident, the fans lining the fence lines were treated to the kind of DD steeze the world hasn&rsquo;t seen since his last season racing U.S. Nationals. Just as podium contention started to become a reality, the announcers bellowed &ldquo;Darryn, get up Darryn!!!&rdquo; signaling that he had gone down, knifing the front end and remounting in mid pack just as his teammate Tyler Bereman made the move by. Watching the Americans battle side-by-side was the bittersweet reward of the moto, but nothing was as cool as seeing Darryn return to his signature form when the going got tough.</p>\r\n<p>As the sun set around 10:00 PM, the boys laced up their DC&rsquo;s and prepped for the many kilometers ahead, roaming the 137 acre festival grounds into the wee hours with friends they had yet to meet. With the Reggae tent at the top of the order, the night was young and the Muntens plentiful with one more day of racing on the agenda. Then after that&mdash;three days in Amsterdam&hellip; and perhaps the very last sighting of The Viewing Death Crue again as they disappear into the nooks and crannies of the Red Light District.</p>\r\n<p>Only time will tell how things go down, and the next installment of this blog to wrap up the rest of The Viewing&rsquo;s European adventure.

  {document_id: 75, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>In spite of having already done it once before, I was still nervous. But when Roland Sands and Cameron Brewer ask you if you want to ride a custom Roland Sands Designs Indian Scout in another Super Hooligan race at the second annual Lost Highway Show in San Bernardino, California, you don&rsquo;t pass it up.</p>\r\n<p>Held at the San Manuel Amphitheater just behind Glen Helen Raceway, this year&rsquo;s Lost Highway show featured a ton of bands, countless motorcycles on display, plenty of beer, and a Super Hooligan race presented by Roland Sands. Cut into a grass field in the middle of everything, the small Hooligan track was prepped and maintained by Speedway legend Brad Oxley and his crew, which included his sons&mdash;successful off-road racers that you&rsquo;ve likely heard of&mdash;Colton Udall and Ian Young.</p>\r\n<p>When I arrived, my anxiety peaked as I walked the track. On paper, riding on fresh grass sounds like any two-wheel enthusiast&rsquo;s dream, but when it comes down to it, grass is slicker than a whiskey fart on a hot summer day&mdash;especially when your bike is equipped with dirt track tires and no front brake. Oh, and it weighs over 500 pounds. Prior to practice, I tried to remind myself of the skills I learned during my first foray into the world of Hooligan competition in Las Vegas, and put it out of my mind that grass was going to make for an experience. And as it turned out, it didn&rsquo;t take long before things got interesting.</p>\r\n<p>As I sat waiting for my first practice session, I looked up just in time to see Cameron Brewer high-side into turn three and gracefully tuck and roll before popping up on his feet to push his bent up Harley off the track for repairs. But that was tame compared to what happened next. Right at the conclusion of the third session we all watched at Shawn Guardado went down in turn four before getting run over by another rider. As Shawn laid on the track motionless, everyone held their breath with a look on their faces, as if to say, &ldquo;This is going to be way&mdash;like a lot&mdash;sketchier than anticipated.&rdquo; Thankfully, Shawn got up with a smashed helmet and a bad concussion, but otherwise okay. While he walked past staging, I took a deep breath and prepared to pull out onto the track.</p>\r\n<p>I got a total of three sessions in&mdash;15 laps&mdash;before it was time to race, and thankfully I managed to get a little more comfortable with each outing. Even though Hooligan racing is intimidating, once you get the hang of it, it&rsquo;s a damn good time on a motorcycle. After trying to cool down in the 105-degree heat, I lined up for the first heat race, which when it was all said and done, turned out to be more of a battle of attrition than an actually race, as I was the only one left on two wheels after five red flag restarts. I guess you could say, I wasn&rsquo;t trying hard enough, but in reality, I didn&rsquo;t want to get any grass stains on my white jeans. My next race was the semi-finals, which didn&rsquo;t go as planned thanks to a horrible start, causing me to finish third, punching my ticket to the consolation race rather than the main event.</p>\r\n<p>My disappointment, though, quickly changed as I lined up next to Andy Bell. Decked out in his Canadian Tuxedo&mdash;denim vest and jeans&mdash;I knew we were going to have a good time. And after battling back and forth through five restarts, the green flag waved for the final time. I came into the first corner way too hot and directly at Bell. The resulting t-bone high-sided me into another rider, whom I bounced off of and proceeded to set my sights on Bell out front, but it was too late. After the numerous re-starts, I didn&rsquo;t have enough time left to catch Bell who was riding like a madman. With that, I sat on the sidelines and watched the finals with my wife and a cold beer.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, but I&rsquo;ll say it again, Hooligan racing has to be experienced to truly understand. On the surface, it looks like a bunch of&mdash;for lack of a better term&mdash;tattooed hooligans on heavy bikes being used in an application they weren&rsquo;t meant for. In reality, though, the camaraderie between the riders, the challenge of riding the heavy bikes on a dirt track, and the overall good time makes Hooligan racing one of my favorite things to do. As is the case with any form of motorcycle racing, Super Hooligan events bring out the best in people. And just like Steve McQueen said, &ldquo;Just when I think everything is wrong with the world, I come out here and see people having fun on motorcycles.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>By Brendan Lutes</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photos by Preston Burroughs</em></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},
  {document_id: 76, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>Somewhere around 5:00 AM on Monday July 18th, the mission began with a rally at The Viewing&rsquo;s secret clubhouse; van primed and the crue bleary-eyed from a zero-sleep night spent working gearbags down to a sub-50 pound weight limit. Captained by Darryn Durham and Tyler Bereman, the Viewing Death Crue is taking the roadshow global to wave the flag for professional funhavers worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>The destination: ZwarteCross, the only motocross race of it&rsquo;s kind that pulls elements of motocross racing, music festivals, and over the top misbehavior into a four-day format for the records books. Let it be known: Training for this event includes everything that a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; (a word we generally discourage) motocross racer should not. Beer drinking, crashing bonfires, road tripping with buddies, and a six-day bender at the annual Mammoth Motocross a couple weeks back have left everyone in prime shape for racing.</p>\r\n<p>Jetlag is a symptom best cured with a blast of adrenaline and 12oz coldie of your choice, so we pinned it south to Marmedy, Belgium, and rendezvoused with the Fest Series Loose Fest crew. Founded on similar ideals to The Viewing, the Fest Series riders are a worldwide band of freeride mountain bikers that are literally pushing the progression curve to vertical with massive jump lines, a jam-session format and content-driven approach that empowers rider&rsquo;s creativity and emphasis on radness.</p>\r\n<p>Loose Fest at BikePark Ferme Libert is perched upon the rolling hills of Hotel LeGrand Champs: A lodge befitting of the swiss alps (who also shares a last name of our filmer, with the infamous Mike &ldquo;Wu-Tang&rdquo; LeGrand) landscaped by endless rolling fields, dotted by deer, goats and the occasional roaming &ldquo;albino elk&rdquo;&hellip;we think. Darryn lead the 4AM charge to the &ldquo;Elk Barn&rdquo; but couldn&rsquo;t scale the double fences&hellip;the world may never know. Complete with a t-bar lift, the LooseFest course features an opening hit measuring out at 79 feet&mdash;that&rsquo;s 14 feet longer than a standard Supercross triple. Pushing 80 feet to clear the deck on a 20 foot tall bicycle landing is nothing short of mind-blowing, and when you add in motos, it&rsquo;s a recipe for pure space cake magic.</p>\r\n<p>Bereman is a two-time attendee of Cruz Fest, and he pulled immediate respect in his first year when he threw down Truckdriver grabs and a huuuuge NacNac that got away from him and robbed him of an ACL. In spite of that, though, he still managed to show up this year to take the game to the next level. Within an hour of watching the LooseFest mayhem begin, he geared up and cracked a couple whips in salute of a massive full moon that capped the trip in proper form. Durham, on the other hand was riding on a borrowed 2011 Yamaha replete with Kawasaki Rockstar logos on the shrouds. The first kick of the kickstarter snapped it off at the casting line. If that wasn&rsquo;t a sign, it&rsquo;s tank-like handling off the opening drop in line sealed the deal that he better save his magic for the fresh 2017&rsquo;s waiting for us at Zwartecross.</p>\r\n<p>This road report is coming to you from the back seat of a VW Minivan, ripping down the highway at about 30 km/h over the speed limit with ZwarteCross pinned on the GPS navigation. Dayle Dabblesworth still thinks he&rsquo;s on I-15 and his sketchy driving tactics made this story nearly impossible to write on the way, but we got it done to beam the good times back to the states where eager eyes await. Stay tuned for more and remember, you win some, you lose some and you wreck some&hellip;. so ya better make sure you&rsquo;re having the most fun, win, lose, or draw!</p>\r\n<p><em>Photos and Report by Aran Eversman</em></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},
  {document_id: 77, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>Making it as an artist is a dream for many. It&rsquo;s a profession that affords you the ability to make a living being creative, but more importantly doing something you love. For Derek Gibson, art has always been a passion of his, and through perseverance and hard work, he was able to combine painting with his other love of motocross.</p>\r\n<p>Over the years, Derek&rsquo;s skills with a brush and pen have allowed him the opportunity to paint during Supercross events, make some money, and donate his work for charity. With his art popping up all over the place, we decided to check in with him to get a little background on how he got into painting, motocross, and what led to him combining the two.</p>\r\n<p><b>How did you get started as an artist?</b></p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked to draw ever since I was a little kid. Right before racing the Millville Pro National, I had a serious head injury from a practice crash that pretty much put an end to my racing. So one day, I started drawing seriously to see what I could do with my artistic ability. Ever since that day, I&rsquo;ve put everything into my artwork so I wouldn&rsquo;t have any more regrets like I have with racing. Someday I want to be able to look at where I&rsquo;m at, good or bad, with my artwork and know I gave it everything I have.</p>\r\n<p><b>What do you enjoy most about painting?</b></p>\r\n<p>I enjoy putting a smile on someone&rsquo;s face when they see the end result of the artwork.</p>\r\n<p><b>Where do you look for inspiration?</b></p>\r\n<p>I get inspiration from the work of other artists. I always compare my work to theirs and want my stuff to be at their level someday.</p>\r\n<p><b>What do you enjoy most about art?</b></p>\r\n<p>The discipline it has taught me; it has taught me to stay focused. Seeing the rewards of the finished product, and hearing that others enjoy it, is very rewarding. It&rsquo;s also pretty rad when I get text messages and phone calls from some of the top pros in the sport of motocross wanting to have artwork done.</p>\r\n<p><b>What is your proudest accomplishment when it comes to painting?</b></p>\r\n<p>Getting to do interviews with companies like yours, and also being featured in the Five Minute Interview with Derek Gibson in <i>Racer X Magazine</i>. This Supercross season I also got to do artwork, of Jason Anderson, in the pits at the St. Louis round while sitting at the Rockstar Husqvarna semi. Another cool thing from my artwork is seeing my hard work pay off in the world of motocross/Supercross, and being able to donate my work and raise money for great causes and events. I also really enjoy getting to do artwork each year for the Legends and Heros Tour Hall of Fame Rider they have for opening ceremonies at Supercross.</p>\r\n<p><b>What are some goals you have for yourself?</b></p>\r\n<p>To be the best artist I can and to build a name for myself in the sport of motocross and action sports. I also want to grow as an artist, and hopefully be able to do my artwork full-time someday.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Derek's Social Media:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Instagram:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/derekgibson951/\">@derekgibson951</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Twitter:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/derekgibson951\">@derekgibson951</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>FaceBook:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/derek.gibson.9250\">Derek.Gibson</a></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},

It brings riders out to compete aboard modified street bikes on flat tracks at interesting venues around The States. One racer that has been at it since the beginning is Jordan Graham. By day, he&rsquo;s a custom helmet painter for Airtrix Custom Paint, but on the weekends, he can be found sliding sideways aboard a 500-pound Roland Sands Designs Indian Scout. &ldquo;Most racing is too serious and no one has fun,&rdquo; Jordan said. &ldquo;At Hooligan races, though, everyone is having a good time while trying to avoid killing each other. It&rsquo;s rad to see how even the playing field is when everyone has no idea what a 500-pound motorcycle is about to do. It can tend to scare the shit out of people.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Witnessing a Hooligan event is one thing&mdash;carnage, near misses, and close racing are just some of the highlights&mdash;but racing one is a completely different animal all together. Getting into it, though, is usually as easy as finding a bike or modifying your own. &ldquo;I got into Hooligan racing after building a street tracker I used to ride to work,&rdquo; Jordan said. &ldquo;I signed up at a local flat track race with a group of other like-minded idiots, not knowing what we were about to get into. After my first high-side crash to my head, though, I knew I was addicted.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the unexpected, the good times, and the camaraderie with buddies that make Hooligan events one of our favorite forms of racing.</p>\r\n<p><em>Words and Photos by Brendan Lutes</em></p>", additional_data: {}, display_order: 1, hidden: nil, created_by: nil, pane: "left"},
  {document_id: 88, type: "DocumentPart::HtmlContent", title: "", content: "<p>We begin this week on a somber note. Legendary filmmaker Bruce Brown passed away peacefully last night at his home in Santa Barbara, California. He was 80 years old.</p>\r\n<p>Bruce was an inspiration to generations of surfers, motorcyclists, and filmmakers. His numerous films provided an escape and glimpse into what we all love about what we now call action sports. His break-through film entitled <i>The Endless Summer</i> showed the public why surfing is so beloved by the diehard Southern Californian surfers, bringing the popular SoCal sport to the Midwest masses. <i>The Endless Summer</i> followed surfers around the world, as they chased perfect waves on picturesque beaches, and Bruce perfectly portrayed that lifestyle with his film. What started as a $50,000 investment by Bruce transformed into a national movement for the surfing community, and ultimately garnered millions of dollars at the box office.</p>\r\n<p>For motorcyclists, though, Bruce&rsquo;s next film <i>On Any </i>Sunday has stood the test time, inspiring generations of motorcycle riders by capturing the true essence of why we choose to twist the throttle&mdash;fun, camaraderie, and family. In the beginning, generating funding for the film proved difficult, but after a meeting with, Steve McQueen&mdash;who helped front the majority of the money needed&mdash;<i>On Any Sunday</i> gained the necessary backing for production. The film went on to garner an Academy Award Nomination for Best Documentary, and has since become an iconic piece of motorcycling history. In the years following the release of <em>On Any Sunday</em>, follow-up films have been produced. Most recently, Bruce's son Dana produced <em>On Any Sunday: The Next Chapter</em>, which was released in 2014.</p>\r\n<p>Here at Fasthouse, Bruce was a friend and he will be missed dearly. When we produced the <i>Day In The Dirt</i> film back in 2002, during the fourth DITD event, Bruce graciously allowed never-before-seen footage from <i>On Any Sunday </i>to be used in the film. Bruce will forever be remember for his film legacy, but he will also be remember for the amazing man he was.

Lesson learned, thank you Roger, we laughed later&mdash;at least I did&mdash;he just smiled. He was fast, and had great cornering speed just like Ryan Dungy.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photo 3: Trans-Am Lexington, Ohio (Mid-Ohio) in 1973. This photo has an interesting story. Mostly all the tracks where natural terrain, even Mid-Ohio, except this year. In this long sweeping turn before the uphill to the finish line, they had built these three humps, and the third one&mdash;that you cannot see in this photo&mdash;is farther apart than the first two. For the most part, everybody was just jumping the first two. My Mom took this photo during the last practice, and prior to it, she told me that Heikki Mikola had just jumped all three. On the last lap, I waited for him to go by and had to ride like hell for a lap to try and keep up with him. Look at all the people watching him do this jump. If you look right behind the guy in Honda shirt and the guy in the Yamaha shirt, both the team racing managers, you can see me watching Heikki do this. I did not start jumping all three until the second moto.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photo 4: Here&rsquo;s another photo that my Mom took. It&rsquo;s Gary Jones the 1972 Inter-Am 250 in Boise, Idaho. This was the Longest and Steepest downhill that we ever raced. It was steeper than Mammoth and four times longer. You could still go pretty fast, though, because it was soft and deep. Look at all the different lines we made.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photo 5: These results were from the Evel Knievel Snake River race. Check out the prize money; that was big prize money for back then. The interesting story here was that after we finished the races, we had a jump contest, and I went second to last in full motocross gear. I went into the lead going nine feet farther than anybody else. The last guy to jump was Kenny Zahrt. He pulled up to the starting spot with a t-shirt on, a pair of jeans, and I swear to God he was wearing a pair of Hush puppies for shoes. He proceeded to blow all of us off, going 18 feet further than me. I don&rsquo;t think he even raced that day and I think he borrowed a 360 Bultaco from either Tom Rapp or Ron Pomeroy. We all laughed and congratulated him. He rang that Bultaco out, shifting gears all the way to the take off ramp and he flew so far&mdash;it was beautiful.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photo 6: I found another photo that my Mom took at WestLake on a Montesa.
