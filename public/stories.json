        "Content": "<p>What began as a small gathering 20 years ago, Red Bull Day In The Dirt has grown into one of the largest events on the west coast, drawing thousands of spectators and riders from all across the U.S. and this year's event was nothing short of epic. Nearly every class was sold out and \"the fastest party in town\" delivered good times over the course of the Thanksgiving weekend. Friday began with Happy Hour practice and a short SoCal Reunion race followed by the 805 Friday Night Drag Races; which led into the weekend's racing, Hell On Wheels TT race, and the rad barn party where the Boogie Knights played for a packed house. If you missed this year, you missed the best DITD yet. Scroll through this huge FH Story to relive all the memories.</p>",

        "Content": "<p>In case you haven't noticed, there's a silent movement happening in the sport of motocross. Over the past few years, Alta has been making major strides in manufacturering a race-ready electric motocross bike. And after spending numerous days at the track with the Alta crew, Darryn Durham decided to put the machine to the test, racing in the annual TransWorld Motocross Slam event at Milestone MX Park. The Slam race is unlike any other, pitting 10 top pros against each other in two five-lap motos with the winner taking the $5,000 lion's share of the $10,000 pro purse. Practice for DD went relatively smoothly, as he went down a couple times while pushing the proverbial envelope aboard the Redshift, but in the end, he made it into the main event. Against the 10 other gas powered MX bikes, Darryn held his own, stayed out of trouble&mdash;for the most part&mdash;and turned in a solid finish in the Redshift's first official motocross race. The Redshift stood up to the abuse, proving that the future looks bright for the electric movement. Relive the weekend with some killer photos from the Alta crew.</p>",

A two-day get together of both the surfing and motocross communities; Surfercross lightheartedly pits surfers and motocrossers against each other over the course of two days&mdash;one at the moto track and the other at one of the most popular SoCal surf spots, San Onofre. Nearly 20 years ago, the event was created by current JGR/Suzuki team manager Jeremy Albrecht and has continued as a passion project for him. Today, it brings together a core group of surfers, riders, and industry insiders for some fun in the sun and dirt. Surfing and the SoCal scene have always been a part of what makes up Fasthouse, and we came on as the official apparal sponsor this year, bringing our own flare and good times along for the ride.</p>",

As was the case with the moto day, the surfing competition is held as a team event, as each team participates in heats together, working their way through elimination to the finals. In moto, the riders help the surfers with pointers, and in surfing, the surfers assist the riders with tips on catching waves. Some try to get some pre-comp practice, but there are the few that just wing it and it's often pretty comical.</p>",

This year, the Fasthouse crew went all out, debuting some rad new gear while showing everyone what it means to have a good times at the races. It isn't always about winning. For us, it's about the memories made and the lasting friendships that are cultivated through a mutual love of two wheel fun.</p>",

        "Content": "<p>With over 4,000 riders during the 10-day event, the final weekend easily drew the largest numbers, and our crew was well represented. Justin Hoeft, Darryn Durham, Kai Mukai, Deegan Vonlossberg, RJ Wageman, and Blayne Thompson all represented FH well in the stacked pro classes. In the pits, they were also well supported, as Thousand Oaks Motorsports and Twisted Development took care of the wrenching on the Gasper Racing machines that Hoeft and Durham competed on. In spite of not taking home the big wooden overall bear in the pro classes&mdash;that went to up-and-coming Yamaha rider Justin Cooper&mdash;our guys still looked the raddest, turned the most heads, and had the most fun.</p>",

After surprisingly making it through last year without any major injuries sustained on the big wheels, Mammoth promoters decided to bring back the mini bikes. It'll be safer they said... It'll be easier they said... With a snow triple, sketchy skateboard ramps, and metal rumble strip whoop sections, this year's mini bike race was anything but mellow and safe. When it was all said and done, though, only one racer limped away injured, and the Fasthouse team of Kai Mukai and Josh Kaller took home the coveted wooden bears.</p>",

This year's Glen Helen National was, as expected, one of the toughest races of the season, but it was also one of the most exciting for us. In his first-ever professional 450 race, Fasthouse's Justin Hoeft&mdash;aboard a mostly stock YZ450F&mdash;ran at the front of the pack, showed some factory riders how to twist the throttle, and ultimately finished a very impressive 11-14 for 14th overall. Before the main motos even got started, though, Ricky Diaz swung a leg over Wacker's bad ass YZ250 for the FMF Two-Stroke Invitational race. It was an epic Saturday filled with ice cold 805s and good times hanging over the fence, cheering for the boys. Scroll down to check out shots from the day.</p>",

Unfortunately for RD, though, after a good start a first lap crash relegated him to the back of the pack. Fortunately for the crowd, that meant his entire focus for the four-lap sprint was to throw massive whips off the humongous finish line triple.</p>",

Not only does the series have classes for every single age, skill, and bike size, but it&rsquo;s also one of the most family-oriented camaraderie-driven organizations out there. Sure, there are the fast pros going for broke and earning a living, but the atmosphere at a Big 6 event harkens back to the days when riders would show up to Indian Dunes with nothing more than an ice chest of beer, a fueled up bike, and a fun-loving attitude. It&rsquo;s this that draws us to these events. Well&hellip; that and the fact that you truly get your money&rsquo;s worth with just a single hour-long race. No endless waiting between motos, wondering if you&rsquo;re race is going to go off the line before the sun goes down.</p>",

Included in that long list were Fasthouse&rsquo;s own Blayne Thompson, Sean Collier, Terry Cook, and more. Having not ridden much lately, Collier still elected to ride in the 30-Plus Class and the brutal Pro Race aboard his freshly rebuilt KX500. And even though he wasn&rsquo;t up front, he still had some fun aboard The Beast. As for Blayne&mdash;who won the opening round at Adelanto&mdash;he started near the front, but ultimately finished fifth in the Pro Race after some bad luck struck again in the form of a wheel malfunction. Up front in the same race, former Supercross racer turned off-roader Zach Bell ran away with the win aboard his OX Motorsports Honda. Behind him, Trevor Stewart brought his JCR Factory Honda across the line in second.</p>",

The race has some of the most diverse conditions around with everything from wide-open desert to motocross to Endurocross to the infamous Adelanto mud jump. This year was no different, and thanks to the torrential rainstorms that have been hammering Southern California recently, the conditions were perfect for dirt bike racing&mdash;nothing can beat freshly watered desert. And for the second year in a row, the Fasthouse crew made the trek up to the desert to race, spectate, and spread some good times.</p>",

Every Thanksgiving weekend, thousands flock to Southern California for the annual Red Bull Day In The Dirt. And this year's event was one of the most memorable yet, as Mother Nature had her way of turning an already epic weekend into one filled with mud, adverse conditions, and even more fun. A photo is worth 1,000 words, and we're going to stop talking and just show you what went down.</p>",
