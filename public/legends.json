  "Content": "<div class=\"row story\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12\">\r\n<p>Actually John started working in films as an actor at the age of three, but by the age of ten his energy and passion had turned to motorcycles. In 1966 at fourteen he won the AMA District 37 100cc TT Championship. At fifteen he was holding his own with the fastest racers in So Cal. Racing was born and bred into him.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the 70&rsquo;s it was hard to make a living as a racer despite being one of the fastest pros in the country. So he came full circle, going back into film work, this time as one badass stuntman. But that competitive fire never goes out, as good friend and fellow stuntman Gene Hartline says about John, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a racer. If you want a definition of what that is, he&rsquo;s it, he&rsquo;ll race you to the bathroom.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-6 col-md-6\">\r\n<div class=\"article-media\">\r\n<p><img src=\"/static/media/uploads/hateley-action.jpg\" alt=\"John Hateley\" /></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"article-media\"><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/mbpk_MStD8c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><span class=\"row-story\"><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/HateleyRacing?feature=watch\" target=\"_blank\">More Hateley Racing Videos</a></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-6 col-md-6\">\r\n<h2 class=\"article-title\">Q&amp;A</h2>\r\n<dl class=\"q-and-a\"><dt>Name</dt><dd>John Hateley</dd><dt>Nickname</dt><dd>Little John</dd><dt>Age</dt><dd>62</dd><dt>Why do you ride?</dt><dd>\r\n<p>When I ride or race I am in control of my life, no thoughts of bills that need to be paid or what is needed to be done at home or what my two sons are up to or any other so called responsibility of life.</p>\r\n<p>When I am on a motor bike I can choose my own destiny at that time, where I ride if I am on my duel sport bike or how fast or how much I want to scare my self when racing a local short track. Or just riding my 1977 XR 75 mini around on the property, big easy laps keeping my feet on the pegs because I don't have a helmet on and it keeps me honest. The best times up until recently was at the Pomona 1/2 mile vintage national going 100mph into turn one on my 750 Triumph DT racer, backing it in up top in the cushion and getting back hard on the gas picking my foot up tucking in down the back shoot headed for the next corner&hellip;. Free, natural adrenaline rush that only comes at that time. That is the best time of life for me.</p>\r\n<p>If I could only have it happen on demand that would be great, but I can't, I need to have a throttle in my hand and the wind in my face, that is why I ride or race&hellip;</p>\r\n</dd><dt>Where do you ride?</dt><dd>I ride all different places&hellip;on my little home GP track or one of two mini short tracks or up in the local hills on a 60 mile loop, sometimes even in the rain. I try to make it to the local Short Track at Perris with my youngest son Ajay and ride the \"Bomber\"class on my 1976 TT 500 Yamaha. When things go right I race at the \"Day in the Dirt\" GP, lately things have not been right, but I will not give up the sport&hellip;.</dd><dt>When you're not riding, you are...</dt><dd>When I am not riding or racing I am fixing something or someones else's bike. And I have been known to build chosen friends vintage race bikes so they too can experience what I grew up on racing.</dd><dt>What do you do for a living?</dt><dd>I use to work full time as a stuntman can honestly work but that like racing slowly goes away with age. There comes a time in life when you can't seem to get on one of the three podium boxes any more. And I am sure if life could be rerun it would happen all the same again. It was a great time in motorcycle history that I grew up in, a lot happened in those years of the 60's 70's and 80's. From no shocks to twin shocks to single shock, I feel blessed to have been there.</dd><dt>Who are your heroes?</dt><dd>I hope it doesn't sound to odd, but I did not have any heroes. I was trying be a racer and to be my own hero. If there was a hero it was my father, he taught me the other side motorcycles, building, machining, welding, always looking for a way to make the machine better.</dd><dt>Moto Memory</dt><dd>Winning the opening AMA TT National at the Houston Astro Dome in 1972 as a first year national number and then again in 1977 both times Triumph mounted</dd><dt>Motorcycle</dt><dd>Triumph 750-650-500-250 in that order, or a 1974 1/2 Maico 440GP</dd><dt>Track</dt><dd>Ascot Park 1/2 mile, Corrignville/Hopetown GP</dd><dt>Races</dt><dd>All races are good</dd><dt>Stunt</dt><dd>One that I could walk away from that others said ,\"I wouldn't do that are you nuts\"</dd></dl></div>\r\n</div>",

He is perhaps the best-known racer from the first 50 years in the sport of motocross. Born in Belgium, Roger came late into riding, getting his first race bike at 17. But he was born with the racing DNA, by 19 he had won the junior 500cc Belgium Motocross title, the Belgium Trials championship, and earned a gold in the ISDT. It was onward and upward from there, winning so many titles it&rsquo;s impossible to list them here. America got to meet Roger for the first time in 1967 when Jim McKay interviewed him on Wide World of Sports at the famous Hopetown Grand Prix in Simi Valley, California. Back in SoCal today, he is still a force to be reckoned with, he is Team Manager of the Red Bull KTM Factory Team in the U.S. A true legend, &ldquo;The Man&rdquo;.</div>\r\n</div>",

But to old moto-heads the 70&rsquo;s meant great tracks, wide open deserts to race on, and rules were few. Ernie was a desert racer and a sometime Grand Prix racer. He helped organize and put on one of the coolest races ever, the Westlake Grand Prix, a stop on the Inter/AM circuit. He was a member of the Viewfinders MC.</p>\r\n<p>He got the bug for putting on events. He and his buddy, George Conrad, started an association called ACE, Alexander Conrad Enterprises. ACE helped build and put on the very first motorcycle races at the world famous Indian Dunes Moto Park.

He won 6 World Championships, 5 in a row. He loved his beer and smoked, often while sitting on the line waiting for the start, and as the story goes on one of these occasions he put the cig out on the helmet of the rider next to him. He then proceeded to win the race.</p>\r\n<p>Stories abound, all of them reinforcing our belief that Joel Robert is &ndash; the Godfather of Motocross.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

He was a natural rider/racer from the moment he climbed on a motorcycle. He shocked the racing world in 1960 at the age of 16 when he started dead last in the legendary <a class=\"article-modal-link\" href=\"javascript:;\" data-article=\"big-bear-run-classic\">Big Bear Run</a> and proceeded to pass over eight hundred racers to take the win. He captured the eye of Bud Ekins who got him a factory ride with Triumph. He&rsquo;s been a Triumph man ever since, winning multiple AMA District 37 championships.</p>\r\n<p>A moment we love the most is when Eddie showed up at the first A Day in the Dirt and partnered up with Mouse McCoy in the team race. And our #2 moment is when Eddie told it like it was on Wide World of Sports the year the world came to Hopetown. Eddie has a style all his own, he&rsquo;s one of a kind.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

His home track was <a class=\"article-modal-link\" href=\"javascript:;\" data-article=\"saddleback-classic\">Saddleback</a> where he spent most of his time as a mini bike star.
