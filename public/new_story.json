We rolled up there with the Bell Helmets crew as well as R-Dog and TMAC. None of us had ever been to the event before but we had all heard a lot about it and we were excited for what was in store. The event takes place on the Sanchez family&rsquo;s property in Grassy Valley, Ca. Luckily, Ron and Debbie Sanchez love Mountain bikes enough to put on the event every year with the help of their son Casey and Daughter Carly. They have a 240-acre ranch that is littered with Rowdy MTB trails that the Sanchez&rsquo;s have built a long with the help of local volunteers. The Sanchez family seems to have a strict rule of &ldquo;no dig, no ride&rdquo; for the locals and that really shows when you see the trails for the first time. There is everything from super fun flowy jump trails to extremely technical wet and rocky sections, which made for some great racing on all 14 stages of the 2-day event.</p>","Images":[],"ImageRows":1,"SectionType":0,"Order":0,"Hidden":false},{"Uid":"c84b4f8d-5cf5-4ca4-a327-434ef98f4d00","Title":null,"Content":null,"Images":["https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/c84b4f8d-5cf5-4ca4-a327-434ef98f4d00/SectionImage0.jpg"],"ImageRows":1,"SectionType":1,"Order":0,"Hidden":false},{"Uid":"da931288-593f-4fcf-8cc1-6155207fa4d1","Title":null,"Content":null,"Images":["https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/da931288-593f-4fcf-8cc1-6155207fa4d1/SectionImage0.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/da931288-593f-4fcf-8cc1-6155207fa4d1/SectionImage1.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/da931288-593f-4fcf-8cc1-6155207fa4d1/SectionImage2.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/da931288-593f-4fcf-8cc1-6155207fa4d1/SectionImage3.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/da931288-593f-4fcf-8cc1-6155207fa4d1/SectionImage4.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/da931288-593f-4fcf-8cc1-6155207fa4d1/SectionImage5.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/da931288-593f-4fcf-8cc1-6155207fa4d1/SectionImage6.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/da931288-593f-4fcf-8cc1-6155207fa4d1/SectionImage7.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/da931288-593f-4fcf-8cc1-6155207fa4d1/SectionImage8.jpg",""],"ImageRows":3,"SectionType":2,"Order":0,"Hidden":false},{"Uid":"3ea49b71-f8a1-459c-a182-a12798d63bc2","Title":"Hecklers and Beer","Content":"<p>The vibe from this event really reminded me of Day in the Dirt.

They were in goofy outfits and yielded the loudest noisemakers they could find. Nothing was going to stop them from heckling all of their friends through the gnarliest sections of each stage and that seemed to be a huge part of what kept everyone stoked.</p>","Images":[],"ImageRows":1,"SectionType":0,"Order":0,"Hidden":false},{"Uid":"a307f1c1-37c5-4d38-a39f-00f98e62e925","Title":null,"Content":null,"Images":["https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/a307f1c1-37c5-4d38-a39f-00f98e62e925/SectionImage0.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/a307f1c1-37c5-4d38-a39f-00f98e62e925/SectionImage1.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/a307f1c1-37c5-4d38-a39f-00f98e62e925/SectionImage2.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/a307f1c1-37c5-4d38-a39f-00f98e62e925/SectionImage3.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/a307f1c1-37c5-4d38-a39f-00f98e62e925/SectionImage4.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/a307f1c1-37c5-4d38-a39f-00f98e62e925/SectionImage5.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/a307f1c1-37c5-4d38-a39f-00f98e62e925/SectionImage6.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/a307f1c1-37c5-4d38-a39f-00f98e62e925/SectionImage7.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/a307f1c1-37c5-4d38-a39f-00f98e62e925/SectionImage8.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/a307f1c1-37c5-4d38-a39f-00f98e62e925/SectionImage9.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/a307f1c1-37c5-4d38-a39f-00f98e62e925/SectionImage10.jpg"],"ImageRows":3,"SectionType":2,"Order":0,"Hidden":false},{"Uid":"2cd05da0-d391-4e8d-b1d0-9c97e72a2837","Title":null,"Content":null,"Images":["https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/2cd05da0-d391-4e8d-b1d0-9c97e72a2837/SectionImage0.jpg"],"ImageRows":1,"SectionType":1,"Order":0,"Hidden":false},{"Uid":"5266e034-2ad4-412a-9489-7ea080245d3c","Title":null,"Content":null,"Images":["https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/5266e034-2ad4-412a-9489-7ea080245d3c/SectionImage0.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/5266e034-2ad4-412a-9489-7ea080245d3c/SectionImage1.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/5266e034-2ad4-412a-9489-7ea080245d3c/SectionImage2.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/5266e034-2ad4-412a-9489-7ea080245d3c/SectionImage3.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/5266e034-2ad4-412a-9489-7ea080245d3c/SectionImage4.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/5266e034-2ad4-412a-9489-7ea080245d3c/SectionImage5.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/5266e034-2ad4-412a-9489-7ea080245d3c/SectionImage6.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/5266e034-2ad4-412a-9489-7ea080245d3c/SectionImage7.jpg","https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/5266e034-2ad4-412a-9489-7ea080245d3c/SectionImage8.jpg",""],"ImageRows":3,"SectionType":2,"Order":0,"Hidden":false},{"Uid":"cd079a17-ffb0-4779-bde1-062528b94372","Title":null,"Content":null,"Images":["https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/cd079a17-ffb0-4779-bde1-062528b94372/SectionImage0.jpg"],"ImageRows":1,"SectionType":1,"Order":0,"Hidden":false},{"Uid":"65f66c9c-cf4a-40a3-ac84-ab72432c8236","Title":null,"Content":null,"Images":[],"ImageRows":1,"SectionType":0,"Order":0,"Hidden":false},{"Uid":"f384a489-26fa-4f90-8db2-f752f63c8961","Title":null,"Content":null,"Images":["https://fasthouse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Stories/stories-417/f384a489-26fa-4f90-8db2-f752f63c8961/SectionImage0.jpg"],"ImageRows":1,"SectionType":1,"Order":0,"Hidden":false},{"Uid":"7f0be93a-5284-4bfc-8af5-95ef59db787a","Title":"Saturday Night Party","Content":"<p>After the races were over each day, the evening festivities began.
